<h2><span class="small">PUBLISHER&rsquo;S PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>In editing and arranging the writings contained in
this book, I used some lifted from religious journals
and some that was still in manuscript form. For their
courtesy extended to me in allowing me to lift from
their papers the writings of my late father, Robertson
L. Whiteside, for publication in books, I wish to express
my deepest gratitude to the present managements
of the: GOSPEL ADVOCATE, GOSPEL GUARDIAN,
and FIRM FOUNDATION.</p>
<p>To the many who have encouraged me in this effort,
thanks. Your comments have been a source of
great joy and inspiration.</p>
<p>It is my hope that this &ldquo;Kingdom of Promise and
Prophecy&rdquo; will, along with the &ldquo;Commentary on
Paul&rsquo;s Letter to the Saints at Rome&rdquo; and &ldquo;Doctrinal
Discourses,&rdquo; fill the present need for sound and careful
Bible teaching. To these will be added, as soon as
time will permit, a compilation of questions and answers
for which I have had many requests.</p>
<p><span class="lr">INYS WHITESIDE</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h2><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Robertson L. Whiteside was a native of Hickman
county, Tennessee, born December 27, 1869, died at his
home in Denton, Texas&mdash;where he had lived more than
forty years&mdash;January 5, 1951. Early in his life (17
years of age), he dedicated himself to the Lord&rsquo;s service.
He was student, educator, and preacher and was
ever on the firing lines in the fight against innovations
and error. The Bible was his standard of faith
and practice. With him, &ldquo;to live was Christ.&rdquo; Like
Jeremiah of old (a character he so loved and admired),
there was a burning fire in his heart he could not contain.</p>
<p>I might write a conventional biography as introduction
to this book; however, it seems to me that the following
lesson from his pen is more revealing of the
purpose of the life that he lived.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">PREACH THE WORD</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I charge thee in the sight of God, and of Christ
Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by
his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be
urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort,
with all long-suffering and teaching. For the
time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves
teachers after their own lusts; and will turn
away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto
fables. But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship,
do the work of an evangelist, fulfill thy ministry.&rdquo;
(2 Tim. 4:1-5.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>An old theme, do you say? What about it is old?
God, Christ, truth, sin, salvation, duty, destiny&mdash;these
never grow old. There is something wrong with one
who thinks any Bible theme is old or out of date. If
there were a cure for all fleshly ailments, would it
ever be &ldquo;out of date&rdquo;? Would any sufferer say of it,
&ldquo;O, that is too old for this progressive age&rdquo;? But
there is no such cure known to man.</p>
<p>But man has a nature more important and enduring
than his flesh, and ailments more far reaching in their
results than any fleshly ills. And the gospel of Christ
is a sure cure for all spiritual and moral ills. As long
as there are moral evils to be corrected, sins to be forgiven,
sinners to be saved, and downtrodden and discouraged
to be inspirited, sorrowing hearts to be comforted,
just that long will the gospel be fresh and &ldquo;up
to date.&rdquo; And what else is up to date?</p>
<p>We have made great advancement in material things,
but these do not meet the needs of the soul. Science
has made great strides in material things, but it has
no remedy for sin and crime. In fact, it has put forces
into the hands of the world that the world does not
know what to do with. In truth, I think it can be safely
said that science has made crime more plentiful and
daring, and has enabled the criminal to escape a hundredfold
more easily. I am not unmindful of the comforts
science has brought to those who know how to
use them; it has also done wonders in combating disease.
But it has put powers in the hands of man that
he does not know how to handle. Even now scientists
are seeking ways and means to destroy whole cities
with one blast. Science has just about perfected means
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
by which civilization will destroy itself in the next
great war. It cannot cure one moral evil, nor generate
one spiritual force for the world&rsquo;s regeneration. And
when a scientist tries to become a philosopher, he becomes
a great injury to the world; for he usually leaves
God out of any scheme of philosophy that he tries to
construct. And psychology and sociology, or any of
the moral philosophies, are equally helpless. Jesus
is the Great Physician, and the gospel is his remedy,
his only remedy, for the evils that afflict the world.</p>
<p>Nothing is up to date that does not meet the needs
of the times. Many things are up to date in meeting
our material needs, but nothing that man has ever
thought out or planned is up to date in a moral and spiritual
sense. Along these lines man&rsquo;s theories are out
of date before they are announced. The most advanced
person in the world along moral and spiritual lines is
the one who adheres most closely to the word of God
and relies most firmly upon it as the one and only remedy
for sin and crime. And the man who says that
such a man is behind the times is himself so far behind
that he does not know that any one has gone on before!
The one who faithfully preaches the word is far in
advance of him who preaches something else. And
yet the majority of the people have never wanted the
plain truth told. They prefer things that please.</p>
<p>Because some professed Christians would not want
the pure word of God preached is one of the reasons
assigned by Paul as to why the word of God should be
preached the more diligently. &ldquo;Preach the word....
For the time will come when they will not endure sound
doctrine.&rdquo; At first thought it might seem that this
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
statement was true in Paul&rsquo;s day; for did they not
persecute and kill preachers then? But Paul was not
here speaking of outsiders. He had in mind the time
when professed Christians would not endure sound
doctrine. Growing tired of the gospel they would long
for something else. &ldquo;Having itching ears,&rdquo; they &ldquo;will
heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts; and
will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn
aside unto fables.&rdquo; It is plain that he was talking
about people who would accept the truth, but later
become tired of it, and would employ preachers that
would tickle their itching ears. It is a dark picture,
but it is not a new picture.</p>
<p>After God&rsquo;s people came out of Egypt, they frequently
drifted into the condition Paul here mentions.
Read the historical books of the Old Testament and
also the testimony of the prophets, and you will find
that God&rsquo;s people never remained true to him very
long at a time. Against them Jeremiah testifies: &ldquo;For
my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken
me, the fountain of living waters, and have
hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold
no water.&rdquo; (Jer. 2:13.) They had turned from the
fountain of living waters as spoken to them by God&rsquo;s
prophets, and had procured for themselves false prophets.
And that was their folly and their sin. Isaiah
delivers a terrific rebuke: &ldquo;The ox knoweth his owner,
and the ass his master&rsquo;s crib: but Israel doth not know,
my people doth not consider.&rdquo; (Isa. 1:3.) They did
not know as much about where safety and food could
be found as did the ox or the ass.</p>
<p>Is there not a need now for straight gospel preaching?
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Of course, a preacher should be a Christian gentleman
at all times, but he should not become too polished
to preach the unadulterated word of God. He
may suffer for it, but what of that? And some misguided
souls may say that plain preaching keeps people
away and injures the standing of the church, but
the faithful preacher knows that that makes it the
more binding upon him to preach the gospel straight.
Because Jeremiah spoke the word of God faithfully,
the people said: &ldquo;This man seeketh not the welfare of
this people, but the hurt.&rdquo; (Jer. 38:4.) And yet he
was the best friend the people had. But they wanted
smooth things spoken to them. They wanted him to
tell them that no evil would come upon them. It appears
that Jeremiah at times grew weary, and felt as
if he might as well give up the strife, but he could
not quit. &ldquo;I am become a laughing-stock all the day,
every one mocketh me. For as often as I speak, I
cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the
word of Jehovah is made a reproach unto me, and a
derision, all the day. And if I say, I will not make
mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then
there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up
in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I
cannot contain.&rdquo; (Jer. 20:7-9.) Jeremiah loved his
people, and could not be quiet as he beheld them plunging
into ruin. A more heroic figure than Jeremiah
does not grace the pages of Old Testament history.</p>
<p>These are perilous times. Man&rsquo;s schemes have broken
down and the world is in chaos. Human wisdom
has come up against a blank wall, beyond which man
cannot see. The people are saying to their erstwhile
leaders, &ldquo;Cry&rdquo;; and the leaders call back, &ldquo;What shall
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
we cry?&rdquo; We have left God out of our scheme of
things. We have dabbled in this monkey business till
conditions have made monkeys out of our wisest men.
But there is balm, there is healing, there is a physician.
Preach the word.</p>
<p>We want to convert sinners and edify saints, but
there is danger that we put the main emphasis on the
wrong things. We may become so busy as herdboys
that we forget to feed the sheep. We may become so
absorbed in keeping the young folks interested that
we forget to fill them with the word of God. We may
become so engaged in building fine meeting houses,
that we forget to build fine Christian characters.</p>
<p>It is a fine thing for a church to have a house suited
to its needs, but a house is not one of the essentials.
The early Christians owned no meetinghouses, but
they made the gospel ring throughout the land. It is
a sin for brethren to burden themselves with a church-house
debt that requires all their energies and resources
to meet. Some churches have so burdened
themselves with debt that they have ceased any worthwhile
effort to preach the word. It is feared that
pride contributed much to their present humiliation.
Some of these monuments to pride or mistaken zeal
will never be paid out, and the church will be discouraged
and weakened, and all because they forgot that
their main mission was to convert sinners and edify
saints. In trying to &ldquo;put things over&rdquo; they have gone
under. PREACH THE WORD.</p>
<p>Do not worry about science. It has its legitimate
field, and in its field it has done wonderful things. We
reap its benefits and are glad. The average preacher
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
knows little about science, and the average scientist
knows less about the Bible. The claim that science
and the Bible do not agree should disturb no one. What
is called &ldquo;science&rdquo; is not static. Each generation
brings new light; most of the old theories have been
exploded by scientists themselves. Yet each generation
of scientists boldly announces that science has
disproved the Bible. But it can as easily be proved
that science has disproved itself. With all their dogmatism
about the Bible and science, there are few
theories that real scientists are willing to take their
stand upon and say: &ldquo;Here is ultimate truth; no future
discoveries will contradict this.&rdquo; So long as they
cannot afford to affirm that they have arrived at ultimate
truth, how can they with honor say that science
disproves the Bible? Besides, if the Bible fully agreed
with the scientific theories of one age, it would not
agree with the theories of the next age. The Bible is
unchangeable and cannot keep up agreement with
that which constantly changes. Some of the foremost
scientists recognize the limitations of science and are
firm believers in the Bible. PREACH THE WORD.
No known truth contradicts the Bible.</p>
<p>But why preach the word? Why did the early
Christians preach the word in the face of such fiery
persecution? Why did Paul, then about to be put
to death for preaching the word, urge upon his beloved
Timothy a course of action that was bound to
bring suffering? Why do we now sacrifice that the
word may be preached? We notice some reasons
why the word should be preached.</p>
<p>The word of God is the seed of the kingdom. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
parable of the sower sets forth this truth as plainly
as language can do so. &ldquo;The sower soweth the word.&rdquo;
That parable sets forth the truth that the word of
God is to the spiritual kingdom exactly what seed is
to the vegetable kingdom. The word produces plants
in the spiritual kingdom just as seed produces plants
in the vegetable kingdom. If this be not so, then no
one can tell what the Savior meant to teach by this
parable.</p>
<p>Life is in the word just as life is in any other seed.
If the seed be not planted, life will not spring up. No
matter how well the soil may be prepared, there will
be no life there till the seed be planted. No matter
how much the heart may be prepared by education,
culture, sorrow, or whatever may come, there will be
no spiritual life in the heart till the seed&mdash;the word of
God&mdash;is planted there.</p>
<p>Seed is able under suitable conditions to transform
dead elements of the soil into life. In nature, this is
the process of reproduction. Those who contend for
a direct operation of the Spirit in regeneration base
their contention on the fact that the sinner is dead.
It is claimed that dead sinners must be made alive by
this direct work of the Spirit before they can obey
the Lord. This is the heart of their contention. Grant
their premise, does their conclusion follow? Is the
sinner&rsquo;s heart any deader than the soil into which
the farmer sows his seed? The farmer knows that
the life inherent in the seed is able to transform dead
soil into a living, growing plant. If the theologians
were as wise as the most ignorant farmer, they would
sow the seed, which is the word of God, knowing that
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
the deadness of the soil&mdash;the sinner&rsquo;s heart&mdash;is no barrier
to an abundant harvest. PREACH THE WORD.</p>
<p>There is saving power in the word. An angel said
to Cornelius: &ldquo;Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose
surname is Peter; who shall speak unto thee words,
whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.&rdquo;
(Acts 11:13, 14.) &ldquo;Wherefore putting away all filthiness
and overflowing of wickedness, receive with
meekness the implanted word, which is able to save
your souls.&rdquo; (James 1:21.) &ldquo;I am not ashamed of the
gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to
every one that believeth.&rdquo; (Rom. 1:16.) Of course,
no one thinks there is power in the material of which
the Bible is made. The power that leads men to
Christ is the thoughts, the ideas, the motives, presented
in the word of God. There is power in a
thought; and power in a motive. By words men move
men, even whole armies and nations. Men&rsquo;s thoughts
have been powerful enough to overthrow kingdoms.
If we want men to act a certain way, we try to fill
them with thoughts and motives tending to lead them
in the direction we want them to go. We stir up action
along certain lines by filling the people with certain
thoughts and motives. In this way we work in
people to induce them to will and do as we think they
should. A man lives out in his life the thoughts he
has in his heart. If we can fill people full of God&rsquo;s
ideas, God&rsquo;s thoughts, we will induce them to do
God&rsquo;s will. In this way God works in people to get
them to live different lives. This helps us to understand
what Paul says in Phil. 2:13: &ldquo;For it is God
who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his
good pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>It is through the mighty power of the word that
men are drawn to Christ. I fear that many preachers
will never get forgiveness for the way they have
treated what the Lord says in John 6:44, 45. They
so often read verse 44 and stop for their usual argument
on the direct drawing put forth by the Spirit.
Of course, when God draws, he draws by his power.
If they would read both verses, they would defeat
their argument made on verse 44. Is that honest?
Is that handling aright the word of truth? Read
both verses: &ldquo;No man can come to me, except the
Father that sent me draw him: and I will raise him
up in the last day. It is written in the prophets, And
they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath
heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh
unto me.&rdquo; (John 6:44, 45.) It is through God&rsquo;s word
that we hear and learn of the Father; in that way
God&rsquo;s drawing power is brought to bear upon us. The
gospel is God&rsquo;s power to save, because it draws men
to Christ, who alone can save.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to put in much time following
the rambling efforts of the debater to prove man&rsquo;s
depravity. Some years ago I had a discussion with
Mr. Ben M. Bogard. On the Spirit question, he made
the usual arguments on the depravity deadness of the
sinner. In my first reply I made the statement: &ldquo;I
object to Mr. Bogard&rsquo;s theory because it limits the
power of God. He has the sinner so dead that God
could not make a gospel that would reach him. I
object to a theory that makes God so helpless.&rdquo; Mr.
Bogard, with more than usual bluster, replied: &ldquo;It is
not a question of God&rsquo;s power. God can do anything
he wants to. He could have made a gospel that would
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
reach the dead sinner&rsquo;s heart, if he had wanted to
do so.&rdquo; I replied: &ldquo;The sinner is not so dead, then,
as we have been hearing he was. Even this personal
contact for which he contends would not have been
necessary if God had made the right kind of gospel.
So the trouble is not in the deadness of the sinner,
but in the inefficiency of the gospel. But God could
have made a better gospel, if he had wanted to. My
contention is that he made the very gospel that Mr.
Bogard says he could have made. Why waste further
time discussing the deadness of the sinner?&rdquo; Of
course, I paid due attention to Mr. Bogard&rsquo;s total-depravity
notions, but he did not recover from his admission.
God made a gospel that is perfectly adapted
to man as he is. PREACH THE WORD.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">If you become a little squeamish about denouncing
false teachers, read Jeremiah. If you think people are so
hardened in sin that they hate you for preaching the word,
read Jeremiah. A careful study of Jeremiah is good tonic
for anyone.</p>
<p class="bq">Jeremiah has been unjustly called the &ldquo;weeping prophet,&rdquo;
as if he were a sort of weakling; whereas there
was never a more heroic soul. Nothing turned him aside
from his duty. If he wept, it was because he loved his nation,
and his heart was torn with the knowledge of what
was coming to his people. He would have been cold-blooded
had he not wept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2><span class="small"><span class="large">Part I<br />QUESTIONS</span></span></h2>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">HAVE ALL PROPHECIES OF OLD TESTAMENT BEEN FULFILLED?</span></h2>
<p>1. Have all the prophecies of the Old Testament been
fulfilled?&mdash;Beaumont</p>
<p>And I might ask: When is a prophecy fulfilled?
Some prophecies are fulfilled in a simple act, or event.
The prophecies concerning the birth of Christ were
fulfilled when he was born, and the prophecies concerning
his death were fulfilled when he was crucified.
Other prophecies concerning single events will occur
to the reader. But some prophecies spoke of conditions
that were to prevail over a long period of time. Study
the prophecies concerning Babylon and Tyre. (Isa.
13:17-22; Jer. 51:60-62; Ezek. 26:7-14.) These cities
were destroyed, as foretold; but they were to remain
in desolation forever. That part of the prophecy is
still being fulfilled. Certain prophecies concerning
Christ, which began to be fulfilled on the first Pentecost
after his resurrection, will go on being fulfilled as
long as time shall last. He was to establish a kingdom;
that prophecy has been fulfilled. But the prophecy
further says: &ldquo;Of the increase of his government and
of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of
David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to
uphold it with justice and with righteousness from
henceforth even for ever.&rdquo; (Isa. 9:7.) This prophecy
began to be fulfilled when Jesus took his seat
upon David&rsquo;s throne and established his kingdom.
But the prophecy says he was to reign upon that
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
throne forever. That prophecy covers the whole
period of time, from the time Jesus began to reign till
he surrenders up the kingdom to his Father. And he
is still saving the people, as the prophets foretold that
he would.</p>
<p>But the prophecies concerning the Jews that the
future-kingdom folks harp on so much have been fulfilled.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">One fact is made to stand out clearly in the New Testament&mdash;namely,
that the Law of Moses, with all its legal
enactments, all its forms, ceremonies, and penalties, ended
at the cross; and it is surprising that any one who professes
to believe the New Testament should think otherwise.
If interested, read Rom. 7:1-6; 2 Cor. 3:4-18; Gal.
3:11-22; 4:21-31; Eph. 2:14-16; Col. 2:14. A thoughtful
reading of the letter to the Hebrews will convince any
one that the old covenant passed away and that we now
have a new and living way.</p>
<p class="bq">Christ loved the church, bought it with his own blood,
and prayed for its oneness. So far as we can, we should
love the church as he loved it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">GIVE US SOME INFORMATION ON OLD TESTAMENT KINGDOM</span></h2>
<p>It is some times difficult to determine just what information
is wanted. There are, however, some things
about &ldquo;the Old Testament kingdom&rdquo; that should be
carefully considered.</p>
<p>When God called Israel out of Egypt, he said to
them: &ldquo;Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed,
and keep my covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession
from among all peoples: for all the earth is
mine: and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests,
and a holy nation.&rdquo; (Ex. 19:5, 6.) For a long period
of time after they settled in Canaan they had no king
but Jehovah; they were, therefore, Jehovah&rsquo;s kingdom.
But there came a time when they wanted a change;
they wanted a centralized government, with a man as
their king. At that time they had an excuse for demanding
a king. Read carefully the eighth chapter of
First Samuel. Samuel was old, and his sons were corrupt.
&ldquo;Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves
together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah; and they
said unto him, Behold thou art old, and thy sons walk
not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all
the nations. But this thing displeased Samuel, when
they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel
prayed unto Jehovah. And Jehovah said unto Samuel,
Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say
unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they
have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
Samuel was commanded to show them the nature of
the government they were demanding. When Samuel
had done so, the people said: &ldquo;Nay; but we will have a
king over us, that we also may be like all the nations.&rdquo;
Jehovah selected Saul as their first king. When the
day of his anointing came, Samuel said to the people:
&ldquo;See ye him whom Jehovah hath chosen, that there is
none like him among all the people?... Then Samuel
told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote
it in a book, and laid it up before Jehovah.&rdquo; (1 Sam.
10:24, 25.) Thus Israel became a kingdom among
kingdoms, and was then reckoned as such.</p>
<p>Israel had not only sinned against Jehovah, but had
rejected him as their king. The kingdom thus established
was not Jehovah&rsquo;s kingdom. While Saul
reigned, it was the kingdom of Saul. (1 Chron. 12:23.)
It was transferred to David because of Saul&rsquo;s sins; it
was then David&rsquo;s kingdom. Any time thereafter it
was the kingdom of the man who was king.</p>
<p>It is strange that some people yet look for that kingdom
to be restored&mdash;a kingdom that was conceived in
sin and brought forth in rebellion against Jehovah!
On one occasion, when Israel was in great distress,
Jehovah said to them: &ldquo;Where now is thy king, that
he may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges, of
whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes? I have
given thee a king in mine anger, and have taken him
away in my wrath.&rdquo; (Hos. 13:10, 11.) With what
emotions do they expect the Lord to restore that kingdom?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">PROMISE TO ABRAHAM: GEN. 13:14, 15 AND ACTS 7:5</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Since Abraham bought even a burying place for Sarah,
and Stephen, in Acts 7:5, says, &ldquo;He (God) gave him none
inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on,&rdquo;
in what sense, if any, did he receive the promise contained
in Gen. 13:14, 15?&mdash;Mrs. Mary B. Robins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, Abraham did not receive actual title to
the land of promise, though the Lord, in some sense,
did give him the land, as will be seen by reading Gen.
28:4; 35:12. He enjoyed its productiveness as fully as
if he had been its actual owner. His vast herds fattened
on its grass and drank water from the wells
which his servants digged. Had God driven out all
the nations and turned the land over to Abraham, he
could not have possessed it nor have made any more
use of it than he did. Stephen certainly did not mean
to say that God had failed in his promise to Abraham.
It seems that Stephen&rsquo;s point was that the promise was
not to Abraham as an individual, but to him as the
founder of a nation&mdash;to his seed. The time for the
promise to be fulfilled would come when Abraham&rsquo;s
posterity became sufficiently numerous to possess
the land. That was clearly Stephen&rsquo;s point, for he
adds: &ldquo;But as the time of the promise drew nigh which
God vouchsafed unto Abraham, the people grew and
multiplied in Egypt.&rdquo; (Acts 7:17.) This shows that
the time for the fulfillment of that promise was when
the people grew and multiplied, and that the time for
its fulfillment was not in Abraham&rsquo;s day, nor is it yet
in the future. It was fulfilled when the nations were
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
driven out of Canaan and the land divided between the
tribes of Israel. &ldquo;So Jehovah gave unto Israel all the
land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and
they possessed it, and dwelt therein.... There failed
not aught of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken
unto the house of Israel.&rdquo; (Josh. 21:43, 45.)</p>
<p>Yet in the face of all this, it has been argued that
the land promise to Abraham must yet be fulfilled, and
that Abraham must be raised and the Jews restored
to Palestine in order for this promise to be fulfilled.
But the argument is mixed. It starts out to prove that
the land must be given to Abraham, and winds up with
his sharing it with the Jews. But Stephen&rsquo;s language
destroys that conclusion, for his language shows plainly
that Abraham and his seed were not to possess it
jointly at the same time. Notice the language: &ldquo;He
promised that he would give to him in possession, and
to his seed after him.&rdquo; Not with him, but &ldquo;after him.&rdquo;
The future-kingdom folks will have a hard time showing
how Abraham will possess the land of Canaan during
a millennium and then his seed possess it after
him.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">THE JEWS AND THEIR KINGDOM</span></h2>
<p>For some time I have had on hand some letters from
an aged Texas brother, an ardent advocate of the
future-kingdom theory and its allied theories. These
letters contain seven closely written pages&mdash;too much
for this page. In his last letter the brother says: &ldquo;You
answer questions for others, but it seems that my
questions are a little too hard for you.... We recall
that some months ago you said that the kingdom of
David and the kingdom of Jehovah were the same
kingdom, and that Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah.
Solomon sat on the throne of David.&rdquo; (1 Kings
2:12, 24.)</p>
<p>When a person asks for information, I give his
question attention as soon as possible; but when a person
is merely trying to flunk me on what he considers
a hard examination, I take the examination when it
suits me. Besides, those who ask for information
should have first consideration. The editor assigned
me the task of answering questions, and not to carry
on debates; but I must break over this time and stand
the examination, and also do a little debating.</p>
<p>But the brother&rsquo;s memory seems to be at fault. I
do not recall saying that the kingdom of David and the
kingdom of Jehovah were the same. At least, that is
not my idea at all. In a general sense God rules in all
the universe, but in a special sense he ruled Israel for
a time. At Mount Sinai, Jehovah said: &ldquo;Now therefore,
if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession from
among all peoples: for all the earth is mine: and ye
shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy
nation.&rdquo; (Ex. 19:5, 6.) Later they rejected Jehovah
as their king. Jehovah said: &ldquo;They have rejected me,
that I should not be king over them.&rdquo; (See 1 Samuel
8:4-22.) God permitted them to have a king. The
resultant kingdom was conceived in sin and brought
forth in rebellion against Jehovah. The people dethroned
Jehovah, so to speak, and organized a kingdom
of their own. &ldquo;It is thy destruction, O Israel, that
thou art against me, against thy help. Where now is
thy king, that he may save thee in all thy cities? and
thy judges, of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and
princes? I have given thee a king in mine anger, and
have taken him away in my wrath.&rdquo; (Hos. 13:9-11.)
And yet all the time of that kingdom the right to rule
the people was Jehovah&rsquo;s. The king sat on Jehovah&rsquo;s
throne over Israel.</p>
<p>But our brother does not think Solomon sat on Jehovah&rsquo;s
throne, but on David&rsquo;s throne. It is strange
that these future-kingdom advocates can see 1 Kings
2:12, 24, but cannot see 1 Chron. 29:23: &ldquo;Then Solomon
sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David
his father.&rdquo; This language shows also that David had
sat on the throne of Jehovah. It was really Jehovah&rsquo;s
throne, but was called David&rsquo;s throne because he occupied
it. And while Solomon occupied it, it was also
his throne. Concerning Solomon, Jehovah said: &ldquo;I
will establish his throne forever.&rdquo; It was Jehovah&rsquo;s
throne, David&rsquo;s throne, and then Solomon&rsquo;s throne.
Hence, God had allowed the people to have their way
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
and put a king on his throne. The management of the
affairs of the kingdom was in the hands of the king.
&ldquo;Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel.&rdquo;
(1 Sam. 14:47.) The whole organization of the kingdom
was in the king&rsquo;s hands. But enough of this.
Here are the questions:</p>
<p>1. &ldquo;Was the kingdom of David a material, visible
kingdom, or an invisible spirit kingdom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a kingdom like other kingdoms. The people
said: &ldquo;We will have a king over us, that we may be like
all the nations.&rdquo; And Jehovah said to Samuel: &ldquo;Hearken
unto their voice.&rdquo; (1 Sam. 8:18-22.) That settles
it. It was a kingdom patterned after other kingdoms.
That kingdom was destroyed and how any sane person
should expect God to restore a kingdom that was organized
in rebellion against him is one of the mysteries.</p>
<p>2. &ldquo;God destroyed it, but said he would restore it as
in the days of old. (Amos 9:11-15.) Has it been restored
as it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>God did not say that he would restore that rebellious
kingdom as it was. The tabernacle of David was the
royal family of David. The royal house, or family, of
David fell. It was set up again when Jesus, of the royal
family of David, was exalted at God&rsquo;s right hand and
made both Lord and Messiah. (Acts 2:29-36.) According
to James, this had to be done before the gospel
could be preached to the Gentiles. (Acts 15:13-19.)
That prophecy of Amos has been fulfilled.</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;Have all Israel been gathered from the nations
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
and given possession of their land, with David as their
king, as prophesied in Ezek. 37:10-24?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ezekiel uttered that prophecy while Israel was in
captivity. Any Israelite who heard or read that
prophecy would understand him to be referring to
their then existing captivity. Our brother does not
believe that the same David of old would be again
their king, but that one of the seed of David would be
king. Jesus was of the seed of David, and is now king.
Neither are the Jews now in captivity. It is strange
that any one would take a passage that speaks of delivering
the Jews from captivity and apply it to the
Jews of today or of tomorrow. In the prophecy referred
to, Jehovah said: &ldquo;I will take the children of
Israel from among the nations, whither they are
gone.&rdquo; They were among the nations at that time,
and from that condition Jehovah would deliver them.
As to whether they then became a glorious nation
would be determined by their own conduct. &ldquo;And at
what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and
concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; if they
do that which is evil in my sight, that they obey not
my voice, then will I repent of the good, wherewith I
said I would benefit them.&rdquo; (Jer. 18:9, 10.) This
prophecy was spoken direct to Israel as a warning to
them.</p>
<p>4. &ldquo;If the kingdom was restored at Pentecost, why
did every apostle after Pentecost that spoke of the
return of Christ put it in the future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old kingdom was not restored, but the kingdom
of God was set up on Pentecost. Christ is on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
throne, where he will sit till all his enemies are subdued.
(Acts 2:35.) The last enemy to be abolished
is death. (1 Cor. 15:26.) Death will be destroyed
when the whole human family is raised from the dead.
Jesus will occupy his present throne till that event is
consummated. He will deliver up the kingdom to the
Father. (1 Cor. 15:26-28.) That leaves no room for
Jesus to reign on another throne before all the dead
are raised. Yes, the apostles spoke of the return of
Christ as future; but, unfortunately for the future-kingdom
theory, they did not put the establishment
of his kingdom in the future. Neither did these ambassadors
for Christ tell us that the Jews would yet
be restored to Palestine.</p>

<p class="bq">Instead of recognizing that God was working out through
them his plan for the redemption of the world, the Jews

to see the truth.</p>
<p class="bq">From the things we learn from God&rsquo;s dealings with nations,

<blockquote>
<p>From Tennessee comes this question: &ldquo;Do the Scriptures
teach that the Jews will return to Jerusalem and
then Christ will come and rebuild the temple there?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We learn from a note accompanying the question
that a Holy Roller or some similar kind of preacher is
creating a little confusion by teaching that the Jews
will return to Jerusalem and Christ will soon come and
rebuild the temple.</p>
<p>There is no way to keep fanatics from making wild
guesses, nor to keep speculators from perverting the
word of God. But if people studied the Bible as they
should, such fellows would create very little confusion.
It is hard to tell just why such a high fever has lately
developed about the future of the Jews. Some preachers
seem not to have much thought for any one but the
Jews.</p>
<p>God promised Abraham to make of his seed a great
nation and to give to them the land of Canaan. (Gen.
12:1-3; 13:14-17.) After Israel came out of Egypt,
God entered into a covenant with them, promising to
make of them a kingdom of priests and a holy nation,
on condition that they obeyed his voice and kept his
covenant. (Ex. 19:5, 6.) But as they neared Canaan,
Jehovah said to them: &ldquo;And it shall be, if thou shalt
forget Jehovah thy God, and walk after other Gods,
and serve them, and worship them, I testify against
you this day that ye shall surely perish. As the nations
that Jehovah maketh to perish before you, so
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
shall ye perish; because ye would not hearken unto the
voice of Jehovah your God.&rdquo; (Deut. 8:19, 20.) The
nations spoken of perished permanently, never to inhabit
Canaan again. Israel was to perish as they did,
if they turned from Jehovah in rebellion against him.
I think one can safely say that not a future-kingdom
advocate believes that Scripture just as it reads.</p>
<p>Some, at least, of those who look for the return of
the Jews to Palestine and the restoration of their old
kingdom tell us that the land promise to Abraham and
his seed was an unconditional promise. If so, why
have the Jews been deprived of their land for eighteen
and a half centuries? If the Jews were driven out
because of their conduct, then the land covenant, or
promise, was conditional. It seems to me that their
theory virtually charges God with a failure to carry
out an unconditional promise. Just here the interested
reader should read carefully Deut. 27 and 28. But
some will tell us that the land promise and the national
promises have not yet been fulfilled to the Jews; but in
so contending they run squarely against plain statements
of Scripture.</p>
<p>After Israel had conquered the land of Palestine and
each tribe had entered into its inheritance, Joshua
called the people together and made an address to
them, in which he said: &ldquo;And behold, this day I am
going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your
hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath
failed of all the good things which Jehovah your God
spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you,
not one thing hath failed thereof.&rdquo; (Josh. 23:14.)
Joshua had already declared: &ldquo;So Jehovah gave unto
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their
fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein....
There failed not aught of any good thing which
Jehovah had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came
to pass.&rdquo; (Josh. 21:43-45.) Hence, they had come
into possession of all that God had sworn to their
fathers to give them. All of God&rsquo;s promises to them
have been fulfilled, even though they never again see
the land of Palestine.</p>
<p>Some centuries after they came into possession of
Palestine the Israelites became so corrupt and rebellious
that they were carried into captivity. Many of
the prophets foretold this carrying away into captivity,
and there were numerous prophecies that they would
be brought back into their own land. These prophecies,
long ago fulfilled, are now brought forward to
prove that the Jews will again be brought back into
their own land. It is a miserable perversion of prophecies
that have had their fulfillment in the restoration
of the Jews from their Babylonian captivity. Why
should any one call it speculation about unfulfilled
prophecy?</p>
<p>The contention that the Jews are yet God&rsquo;s chosen
people, and that he yet has in store for them special
blessings that are not obtainable by other people, is in
direct contradiction to God&rsquo;s whole plan of salvation
through Christ. The plain teaching of the New Testament
is against such an idea, and yet it is God&rsquo;s final
revelation to man, and shows the full development and
perfection of all the plans and purposes which God
began in the Old Testament to outline in promise,
prophecy, and type. Hence, if God has yet in store
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
some special blessings for the Jews, he certainly would
have told us about it in the New Testament; but instead
of giving us such information, the New Testament
distinctly and emphatically teaches that now
fleshly relations count for nothing. Although Paul
was &ldquo;of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a
Hebrew of the Hebrews,&rdquo; he counted such fleshly relations
as but refuse, and declared that he had no confidence
in the flesh&mdash;that is, in any fleshly relations.
(Phil. 3:2-8.) In 2 Cor. 5:14, 15, Paul declares that
Christ died for all, and because of that fact he adds,
&ldquo;Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the
flesh&rdquo;&mdash;we give no distinction to any man because of
his nationality. &ldquo;Even though we have known Christ
after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.&rdquo;
(verse 16.) No one thinks of Christ as a Jew with a
Jew&rsquo;s narrow nationalistic traits, but as a world savior.
That he so often referred to himself as the <i>Son of man</i>,
and not as a Jew, is more significant than many think.
It sets him before us as equally related to all men and
as equally interested in all men. Jehovah is not a
tribal God and Jesus is not a tribal king, as most of
the future-kingdom folks seem to believe.</p>
<p>Jesus himself gives us a picture of the latter end of
the Jews. Read Matt. 12:43-45. The unclean spirit,
having been driven out of the man, returns to the man
with seven other spirits worse than himself. &ldquo;And the
last state of that man becometh worse than the first.
Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation.&rdquo; If
the word here translated <i>generation</i> means <i>race</i>, as it
often does, the future of the Jewish race is dark indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>In applying the lesson of the parable of the householder,
Jesus said: &ldquo;Therefore I say unto you, the
kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and
shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
thereof.&rdquo; (See Matt. 21:33-43.) This nation is the new
Israel of God, the church. Christians are now the
circumcision. (Phil. 3:3.) Christians are now &ldquo;Abraham&rsquo;s
seed, heirs according to promise.&rdquo; (Gal. 3:29.)
The promises and prophecies that have not been fulfilled
to fleshly Israel are to be fulfilled to the church,
which is now God&rsquo;s Israel.</p>
<p>It has already been shown that there is no ground
for expecting the Jews to return to Palestine. Instead
of finding any teaching to that effect in the New
Testament, as we would expect to find if such is to
take place, we find the weight of New Testament
teaching to be against such an event.</p>
<p>The return of the Jews to Palestine, the rebuilding
of the temple, and the restoration of the Jewish kingdom
are all so interwoven in the program of the future-kingdom
advocates that they stand or fall together.
It is a significant fact that the prophecies relied on to
prove the fore-going propositions were all uttered before
the Babylonian captivity or during that captivity.
The Babylonian captivity had often been foretold.
Therefore, when any prophet spoke of the regathering
of the Jews to Palestine and the rebuilding of their
temple, every Jew of that time would understand the
prophet to be speaking of their return from Babylonian
captivity and the rebuilding of their temple then.
Ezekiel prophesied during the captivity, being himself
one of the early captives. Of course, anything he said
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
about the return of the Jews and the rebuilding of the
temple would be understood by every Jew of that time
as referring to their deliverance from their present
captivity. Without some special words of explanation
they could not have understood it otherwise. But no
such words of explanation were given. The prophets
knew how the Jews would understand them, and yet
they let it go at that. Are we to understand that God,
through his prophets, deceived the Jews? Surely not.
The prophets foretold the return of the Jews from captivity.
The Jews would understand them to refer to
their return from Babylonian captivity. What then?
Sound principles of exegesis demand that these circumstances
and conditions be taken into consideration
in the application of these prophecies. This the
future-kingdom advocates fail to do. But they tell us
that some of the promises in these prophecies concerning
the return of the Jews from captivity have not yet
been fulfilled. But such an affirmation ignores the
conditionality of God&rsquo;s promises. It is the same blunder
that is made by the advocates of the impossibility
of apostasy. Even if it could be shown that some
things promised to the Jews on their return to Palestine
were never fulfilled, that would not prove that
they will yet be fulfilled. The human side must be
taken into consideration. Hear the Lord through Jeremiah:
&ldquo;Behold, as the clay in the potter&rsquo;s hand, so are
ye in my hand, O house of Israel.... And at what
instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning
a kingdom, to build and to plant it; if they do that
which is evil in my sight, that they obey not my voice,
then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would
benefit them.&rdquo; (Jer. 18:5-10.) This is God&rsquo;s warning
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
to Israel, but it has no weight with the future-kingdom
advocates.</p>
<p>The Lord brought the Jews back from captivity and
planted them in their land. They would have had
God&rsquo;s choicest blessings had they obeyed his voice; but
they failed him, and plunged into the grossest sins.
This criminality culminated in their murdering the
Son of God and many of his saints. It was not the crimes
of individuals here and there, but the deliberate crimes
of the nation. Death is the punishment for deliberate
murder. National murder demanded national death.
The Jewish nation suffered that death in the destruction
of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When God sent his Son into the world, he did not
send him to reorganize the Jewish kingdom, but to
open up a way of salvation for sinners. He did not
fail to accomplish what he was sent to do, as the
future-kingdom advocates claim. Hear his own words:
&ldquo;I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished
the work which thou hast given me to do.&rdquo; (John
17:4.) That statement should settle a lot of speculation
about the rejected king and the postponed kingdom.</p>
<p>When Jesus comes again, he will not come to rebuild
the temple in Jerusalem, but to render judgment.
(Matt. 25:31-46; 2 Thess. 1:6-10.) His temple is here
now. &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build my church.&rdquo; (Matt.
16:18.) That church is his temple. &ldquo;Know ye not
that ye are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of
God dwelleth in you? If any man destroyeth the
temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
God is holy, and such are ye.&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:16, 17.)
&ldquo;Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner
stone; in whom each several building, fitly framed
together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord; in
whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of
God in the Spirit.&rdquo; (Eph. 2:20-22.) In the old material
temple, animal sacrifices and other material
sacrifices were offered; in this new spiritual temple,
spiritual sacrifices are offered. &ldquo;Ye also, as living
stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy
priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable
to God through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:5.) Can any
one believe that we are to give up this glorious spiritual
temple for the old material temple? this spiritual
worship for the carnal ordinances of the material temple?
If so, he has poor taste for the spiritual.</p>
<p>The temple in Jerusalem was but a type, a shadow,
of this glorious spiritual temple. (Heb. 9:1-10.) This
spiritual house is a &ldquo;greater and more perfect tabernacle.&rdquo;
(Heb. 9:11.) Now, we are gravely told that
in the millennium we will exchange this glorious
spiritual temple for the material temple with its
animal sacrifices, give up the substance for the
shadow, give up the gospel of grace for the law of the
temple, which means the law of Moses. That temple,
we are informed, will be again sanctified by the blood
of animals. Such material conceptions as this whole
future-kingdom idea suits very well such materialists
as the Russellites, but has no place in the thinking of
one who glories in the cross of Christ and in his blood-bought
church.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>As a sample of the passages relied on to prove that
the Jews are yet to be restored to Palestine and their
temple rebuilt, read Ezek. 34:11-31; also chapters 37;
39:21-29, and to the close of Ezekiel. Remember, as
you read, that Ezekiel prophesied while he and his
nation were in captivity. In the temple of which
Ezekiel speaks there were to be all the offerings and
ceremonies required by the law of Moses. The blood of
the animal sacrifices served the same purposes as the
law specified. The priests were of the tribe of Levi.
This cannot refer to the future, for no Jew now knows
to what tribe he belongs. With the blood of animals
atonement was to be made for the people. If a man
can believe all this is yet future, he can believe anything
that suits his fancy; facts will be no barrier to
anything he wants to believe.</p>

captivity they were to be delivered. (See verses 21, 22.)
The dry bones coming to life represented their return from
captivity. Their return would be as if they were coming
alive from the dead. Their captivity was their burial;
their return would be as if they were coming from their
graves. They had been divided into two kingdoms. Joining
the two sticks into one stick represented the joining
of the two peoples into one nation after their return. Their
return is told in Ezra and Nehemiah. After that return
they were one people. And they would have had a glorious
kingdom had they obeyed Jehovah. The prophecies
of the Old Testament concerning the fate of the Jews in
their disobedience are being fulfilled all down the ages.</p>

<p>Has the prophecy in Amos 9:13-15 been fulfilled?&mdash;Mrs.

<p>Amos 9:13-15: &ldquo;Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah,
that the plowman shall overtake the reaper,
and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and
the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills
shall melt. And I will bring back the captivity of my
people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and
inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and
drink the wine thereof; they shall make gardens, and
eat the fruit of them. And I will plant them upon their
land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their
land, which I have given them, saith Jehovah thy God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amos had gone from his home at Tekoa to Bethel to
prophesy against the kingdom of Israel, which had become
very corrupt, and to warn the people of their coming
doom. (Amos 1:1; 7:7-17.) They were to be
sifted, scattered, among the nations. As Amos was
speaking of their captivity, which they later suffered,
it seems reasonable to conclude that the verses in
question referred to their return from that captivity.
All who wanted to return from that captivity to their
own land had abundant opportunity. There is no evidence
that the Jews will again be carried out of their
own land into captivity, so as to be brought out of captivity
in the future. All the prophecies that speak of
a return of the Jews out of captivity have been fulfilled.
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
One thing is sure: they are not now in captivity;
therefore, they could not now be brought out
of captivity, unless again carried into captivity.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<h4>ALL THINGS THAT PERTAIN</h4>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us
all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through
the knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and
virtue.&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:3.) We are in the habit of saying that
God has given us in the gospel everything that is essential
to life and godliness; but Peter goes a little farther
than that and affirms that God has given us all things
that pertain to life and godliness. There is a difference.
To illustrate: There are certain things that are essential to
an automobile; and there are other things that pertain to
an automobile; but are not essential to it. When you have
all things that are essential to an automobile, you can go
to a supply house and purchase a lot of extras that pertain
to an automobile. But suppose you have all the essentials
of an automobile, and then you add all the things that
pertain to an automobile, nothing else could be added that
would make it any more complete. God has not only
given us all things that are essential to life and godliness,
but he has given us all things that pertain to life and godliness.</p>
<p class="bq">But do religious people believe it? If so, why all these
flummeries that God has said nothing about? If you will
read the verse again, you will notice that he has given us
all these things through the knowledge of Christ. The
knowledge of Christ means the knowledge that has been
revealed about him&mdash;the gospel of Christ. Hence, through
the gospel God has not only given us all things that are essential
to life and godliness, but all things that pertain to
life and godliness. If there is, therefore, anything in your
religion that did not come to you through the gospel, it
does not so much as pertain to life and godliness. Is it
not time to check up on our religion and see if we have anything
that we cannot find in the New Testament? Any
person of intelligence can do that for himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please explain Matt. 16:28. I have to contend with the
Boll theory. What I want to know is how the disciples were
to &ldquo;see&rdquo; the Son of man coming in his kingdom.&mdash;W. C.
Anderson.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matthew 16:28.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily I say unto you, There are some of them that
stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they
see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this verse it is stated that some would <i>taste</i> of
death&mdash;some of them would <i>see</i> the Son of man coming
in his kingdom. <i>Taste</i> and <i>see</i>&mdash;are these terms used
literally? A little study of both words will help. &ldquo;Oh
taste and see that Jehovah is good.&rdquo; (Ps. 34:8.)
&ldquo;Sweet are thy words unto my taste.&rdquo; (Ps. 119:103.)
&ldquo;Tasted of the heavenly gift&rdquo;; &ldquo;tasted the good word
of God.&rdquo; (Heb. 6:4, 5.) If you make <i>see</i> represent
the actual functioning of one of the five senses, why
not make <i>taste</i> do the same? No man actually tastes
death as he tastes food. The future-kingdom folks
stress giving words their literal meaning, but even
they will not say that a man tastes Jehovah, his word,
or death, as he tastes food. So also the word <i>see</i> has
a variety of meanings, or uses. To see often means to
know. &ldquo;Taste and see (know) that Jehovah is good.&rdquo;
To see often means to experience. We see joy and we
see a good time; we see trouble and sorrow. Taste
death&mdash;experience death, or suffer death. The parallel
passages, Mark 9:1 and Luke 9:27, say: &ldquo;Verily I say
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
unto you, There are some of them that stand by, who
shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom
of God come with power.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I tell you of a
truth, There are some of them that stand here, who
shall in no wise taste of death till they see the kingdom
of God.&rdquo; To see the Son of man coming in his kingdom
and to see the kingdom of God come with power
and to see the kingdom of God are different expressions
of the same idea. When the kingdom of God came
with power, it was Christ coming in his kingdom. Just
as certain as some of those standing by would die before
the kingdom came, or the Son of man came in his
kingdom, just that certain some would live till that
event occurred. Ye&mdash;those standing by, not those of
some future date&mdash;shall see the Son of man coming in
his kingdom, or see the kingdom of God come with power,
and they would see it before they died. The future-kingdom
folks do not see that part of what Jesus said;
they see only &ldquo;see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.&rdquo;
And yet no man literally sees a kingdom, as he
sees a material object; for the &ldquo;kingdom of God cometh
not with observation&rdquo;&mdash;that is, not in such a manner
that it can be watched with the eyes; i. e., in a visible
manner. (Luke 17:20.) Jesus made that statement
in answer to the Pharisees&rsquo; question as to when the
kingdom of God would come. Hence, some of the disciples
to whom Jesus was talking would see Jesus coming
in his kingdom; yet they would not see with their
eyes. Jesus himself declared that his kingdom would
not come in that manner.</p>
<p>The future-kingdom folks put stress on the statement:
&ldquo;They shall see the Son of man coming on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
clouds of heaven with power and great glory.&rdquo; But
notice the change in pronouns&mdash;&ldquo;ye shall see,&rdquo; &ldquo;they
shall see.&rdquo; They tell us that this coming on the clouds
will be when he comes in his kingdom. They also tell
us that when he thus comes the wicked dead will not
see him, for they will not be raised till the end of a
thousand years. But there is a hitch in that. Certainly
the high priest who condemned Jesus to death belongs
in the class of the wicked dead yet Jesus said
to him and to the court: &ldquo;Ye shall see the Son of man
sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the
clouds of heaven.&rdquo; Notice the word <i>henceforth</i>&mdash;from
now on. Notice, too that this wicked court was henceforth
to see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of
power. No man sees him sitting with his natural eye.
The word <i>see</i> here has two objects, <i>sitting</i> and <i>coming</i>;
or, rather, the same persons shall see Jesus sitting and
coming. Even a child should be able to see that the
word <i>see</i> could not here mean a mental conception as
to one of its objects and an actual seeing with the eyes
as to the other object. A word may have several meanings,
but it cannot have two meanings at one and the
same time. As some of the disciples then living were
to see Jesus coming in his kingdom and the Sanhedrin
were to see him sitting on the right hand of power, the
Lord came in his kingdom during the lifetime of these
people.</p>

<p>Matthew 19:28; 25:31; Luke 22:28-30; 1 Cor. 6:2,
3. Please explain&mdash;Owen W. Smith.</p>
<p>1. Matt. 19:28: &ldquo;And Jesus said unto them, Verily
I say unto you, that ye who have followed me, in the
regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit on the
throne of his glory, ye shall also sit upon twelve
thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&rdquo; Read
the context. The rich young man had refused to follow
Jesus. Peter said: &ldquo;We have left all, and followed
thee; what then shall we have?&rdquo; The reply of Jesus
does not mean that they had followed him in the regeneration,
for Jesus had passed through no regeneration.
Luke says they had followed him in his temptation.
Jesus was telling his apostles what they would
have in the regeneration. The regeneration is that
period of time in which people are being regenerated.
The other passage in which the word &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo;
occurs shows that people are being regenerated in this
dispensation. (Tit. 3:5.) But it was during this time
of regeneration that Christ was to sit on the throne
of his glory and the apostles were to sit on thrones.
Hence, both Jesus and his apostles are now on their
thrones, for all were to sit on thrones at the same time.
On Pentecost, Peter declared that God had raised up
Jesus to sit on David&rsquo;s throne and had made him both
Lord and Christ. (Acts 2:30-36.) Jesus himself declared
that all authority had been given to him. Those
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
who say that he has all authority, but is not exercising
it, overlook the <i>therefore</i> in the next verse. Suppose
Jesus had expressed that idea, it would have read
something like this: &ldquo;All authority has been given me,
but I am not exercising it; and because I am not exercising
it, go into all the world and make disciples of
all the nations.&rdquo; The command was based on his having
all authority. Some have overlooked the <i>therefore</i>.
As Jesus is on his throne, so are the apostles on
their thrones. But how are they judging? McGarvey
says on this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This statement of Paul that &ldquo;the saints shall judge the
world&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:2) has led many to suppose that the judging
here mentioned is to take place at the final judgment.
But clearly the judging and the sitting on the thrones
are declared to be contemporaneous with the regeneration
and with Christ&rsquo;s sitting on his throne; and, therefore,
they must be regarded as now in progress. If we are correct
in this, of which we entertain no doubt, the judging
consists in pronouncing decisions on questions of faith and
practice in the earthly kingdom, and the twelve are figuratively
represented as sitting on thrones, because they
are acting as judges. During their personal ministry
they judged in person; since then they judge through their
writings. True, we have written communications from only
part of them, but judgments pronounced by one of a bench
of judges with the known approval of all are the judgments
of the entire bench.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the <i>twelve tribes</i> he remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The apostles have sustained no such relation to the
twelve tribes of Israel, literally so called, as the text indicates,
nor is there any intimation in the Scriptures that
they ever will. Their work is with the true Israel, and not
with Israel according to the flesh; consequently, we are
to construe the terms metaphorically, the twelve tribes
representing the church of God of which they were a type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In judging, the apostles declare who is free from
guilt and who is condemned. This is made plain in
John 20:23: &ldquo;Whose soever sins ye forgive, they are
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
forgiven unto them; whose soever sins ye retain, they
are retained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. Matt. 25:31: &ldquo;But when the Son of man shall
come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then
shall he sit on the throne of his glory.&rdquo; This verse
is incomplete, and is really explained by the rest of the
chapter. He shall sit on the throne of judgment, and
before him will be gathered all nations for judgment;
but the people will be judged as individuals and not as
nations. It is not a judgment of nations, or governments,
as has sometimes been said. Even a little attention
to the gender of the Greek words of the passage
will show how ill-founded is that assumption. &ldquo;Nations&rdquo;
is neuter in the Greek; it cannot, therefore, be
the antecedent of <i>them</i> in verse 32, for it is masculine.
And so is <i>ye blessed</i> in verse 34, and <i>ye cursed</i> in verse
41. Both <i>these</i> and <i>the righteous</i> in verse 46 are masculine.
It is, therefore, not a judgment of nations, as
such, but of the people. The passage is in perfect harmony
with 2 Thess. 1:6-10. Here he comes to take
vengeance on the wicked and to be glorified in his
saints. It is, therefore, the judgment at the last day.</p>
<p>3. Luke 22:28-30: &ldquo;But ye are they that have continued
with me in my temptations; and I appoint unto
you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto
me, that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom;
and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve
tribes of Israel.&rdquo; Read the context. They had just eaten
the Passover and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. A contention
had arisen between the disciples as to who would be
accounted the greatest; and Jesus had told them that
there was to be no one among them exercising lordship
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
over the others, but that service would be the thing that
counted. The apostles had faithfully followed him in
his temptation; he would, therefore, appoint them a
kingdom, and they would eat and drink at his table in
his kingdom. On account of the fact that they had just
eaten the Lord&rsquo;s Supper we naturally associate the
Lord&rsquo;s table with the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. They, therefore,
would eat the Lord&rsquo;s Supper in his kingdom. But the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper will not be eaten after he comes again.
But as they were to eat it in his kingdom, it is certain
that they ate it in his kingdom while they lived. The
kingdom now in existence is, therefore, the kingdom he
appointed them. In Luke 12:32, Jesus said: &ldquo;Fear
not little flock; for it is your Father&rsquo;s good pleasure to
give you the kingdom.&rdquo; The Father was to give this
kingdom to the &ldquo;little flock.&rdquo; This cannot mean that
he will give his kingdom to his followers at the end of
this dispensation, when the little flock shall have
swelled into &ldquo;a great multitude, which no man could
number, out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples
and tongues.&rdquo; (Rev. 7:9.) No; it was to be given to
a little flock and not to a numberless host, and the
language clearly shows that it was to be given to those
who were then present. And that was the kingdom
which he appointed to them, and in which they sit on
twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. On
this last point, see comments above on Matt. 19:28.</p>
<p>4. 1 Cor. 6:2, 3: &ldquo;Or know ye not that the saints
shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by
you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
Know ye not that ye shall judge angels? how much
more, things that pertain to this life?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Commentators have had no end of trouble over these
verses, and there is little agreement among them. In
some sense saints judge the world and angels, but
how? and when? It is a hazardous and foolish thing
to build a theory on a difficult passage, especially when
little, if any, light on the point can be gained from
other Scriptures. But it does not seem possible that
Christians will be judges in the last day, when all
shall be judged. From Matt. 25:31-46 we learn that
the righteous will be judged along with the wicked.
Saints will not then occupy judgment thrones, but
will be gathered before the judgment throne. They
cannot be judges while being judged. After that they
cannot judge the world, for the world will already
have been judged. And there is no Scripture that
teaches that the heavenly angels will then be judged
by any one. But the gospel is God&rsquo;s law, and every
time it is preached sinners are judged as guilty, as are
also the devil and his angels. And saints have this
same law by which to judge among themselves. These
are facts, whether the passage in question has that
meaning or not. This view has the merit of not being
out of harmony with the general teaching of the New
Testament. But let us be sure not to build a theory
on a difficult passage of Scripture, nor use it in support
of a theory. We might be found wresting the
Scripture to our own destruction.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JEWS, THE KINGDOM AND SALVATION</span></h2>
<p>Tell me: When, or how, did Christ offer the Jews
the kingdom? What passage, or passages, or teaching
as a whole do you think the earth-kingdom advocates
rely on to prove the statement that the kingdom was
offered the Jews?</p>
<p>Was the kingdom offered the Jews in any sense that
<i>salvation</i> was not offered them?</p>
<p>Did they reject the kingdom in any sense they did
not reject salvation?</p>
<p>If the kingdom was offered the Jews, and they rejected
it, and the Lord for that reason postponed the
kingdom, why is it he did not also postpone the salvation
offered?&mdash;X</p>
<p>Perhaps I might as well answer the foregoing
questions as a whole as to answer each one separately.
The querist has been doing some close thinking, and
his questions open up a field for some profitable investigation.</p>
<p>The querist evidently refers to the Jews as a nation,
and not as individuals. It is claimed by the kingdom
speculators that Jesus offered the kingdom to the
Jewish nation on condition that the rulers and people
alike repent, but the assertion is not backed up by any
definite proof. The advocates of that notion arrive at
such a conclusion by assumptions and deductions.
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
They assume that the prophets foretold the restoration
of the old kingdom of Israel, a kingdom that was born
in rebellion against God and in rejection of him as
King! They assume that Jesus offered the kingdom to
the Jews as a nation, but they gave no proof that Jesus
offered that kingdom or anything else to a national
Israel. But as such a kingdom did not come into being,
they conclude that both the king and his kingdom were
rejected. Matt. 3:2 is quoted in this connection, but
they do not show how that Scripture proves their contention.
John was preaching to individuals, and not
to the nation as such. The fact is that he never did
go and preach to the rulers, nor did they come to him.
They did send a committee to inquire into his work.</p>
<p>I see no way to separate the kingdom from salvation,
nor can I see how one can exist apart from the other.
Of course the old kingdom had citizens who were not
in a saved state, but I do not see how that could be true
of the kingdom of Christ. However, we are told that
only Jews who are born again will be citizens of the
kingdom which they suppose Christ will set up when
he comes again. In that respect, as well as in many
others, this supposed kingdom will not be like the old
kingdom.</p>
<p>That the future-kingdom advocates realize they have
no certain proof of their rejection and postponement
theory is shown by the fact that they do not agree on
any certain Scripture, nor as to the time of this supposed
rejection and postponement. John R. Rice puts
it in the tenth chapter of Matthew; Scofield, in the
eleventh; R. H. Boll, in the twelfth. John R. Rice
says the kingdom at hand was never preached after
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
the tenth chapter; the offer was then withdrawn. He
should have read what Jesus a year later instructed the
seventy to preach. (Luke 10:11.) In a note on Matt.
11:20-24 Scofield says: &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven announced
&lsquo;at hand&rsquo; by John the Baptist, by the King
himself, and by the twelve, and attended by mighty
works, has been <i>morally</i> rejected. The places chosen
for the testing of the nation&mdash;Chorazin, Bethsaida,
etc.&mdash;having rejected both John and Jesus, the rejected
King now speaks of judgment. The final official rejection
is later. (Matt. 27:31-37).&rdquo; On verses 28-30
he says: &ldquo;The new message of Jesus. The rejected
King now turns from the rejecting <i>nation</i> and offers
not the <i>kingdom</i>, but <i>rest</i> and <i>service</i> to such in the
nation as are conscious of need. It is a pivotal point
in the ministry of Jesus.&rdquo; R. H. Boll says: &ldquo;In chapter
twelve the antagonism of the Pharisees, stirred to
its height by his Sabbath healing, came to a terrible
climax: they went out and took counsel against him
<i>how they might destroy him</i>. (12:14.) This was a
great turning point.&rdquo; As they find no Scripture which
says what they claim, they depend on assumptions
and deductions, and their deductions do not agree.</p>
<p>A PROPOSITION: The gospel plan of salvation
is the scheme of redemption foretold in promise and
prophecy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">SOME QUESTIONS CONSIDERED</span></h2>
<p>A brother has presented to me a few questions for
my consideration. The questions are about matters
that are being much agitated these days. The first
question indicates that somebody thinks the Lord refused
some people the privilege of believing, lest he
might get more followers on his hands than he needed
for future rulers! But to the questions:</p>
<p>1. &ldquo;Was there ever a time when God refused any
one the privilege to believe in Christ, as indicated in
John 12:39, 40? If so, has he revealed the purpose
thereof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passage mentioned says: &ldquo;For this cause they
could not believe, for that Isaiah said again, He hath
blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; lest
they should see with their eyes, and perceive with
their heart, and should turn, and I should heal them.&rdquo;
The quotation is from Isa. 6:10. In Isaiah&rsquo;s day the
people of Judah had become very corrupt, and were
growing worse. To these people Jehovah said: &ldquo;Ah
sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
evil-doers, children that deal corruptly! they have
forsaken Jehovah, they have despised the Holy One
of Israel, they are estranged and gone backward.&rdquo;
(Isa 1:4.) They had reached the point where they
were utterly unfit to manage their own affairs of government.
The great majority were beyond the hope
of reformation. They would not even consider Jehovah,
and were more senseless as to their own good
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
than the ox or the ass. &ldquo;The ox knoweth his owner,
and the ass his master&rsquo;s crib; but Israel doth not know,
my people doth not consider.&rdquo; (Verse 3.) When people
reach that stage, there is nothing to do but to hasten
them on to their doom. Hence, Jehovah said to
Isaiah when he sent him to prophesy to the people of
Judah: &ldquo;Make the heart of this people fat, and make
their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see
with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand
with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.&rdquo;
(Isa. 6:10.) Isaiah could do this only by his teachings
and warnings. They were so determined in their rebellion
that the more Isaiah warned them, the harder
their hearts became. Their sinfulness resulted in
the Babylonian captivity. The Jews had again become
so sinful that a worse calamity was soon to come upon
them. The leaders rejected the preaching of John and
dogged the steps of Jesus every move he made. They
were so rebellious that the miracles and teaching of
Jesus hardened their hearts instead of converting
them. There was no direct operation on their hearts
to keep them from believing. The things that made
believers of some hardened the hearts of others. The
Lord never did keep any honest heart from believing.
The prophecy quoted in John 12:39, 40 is quoted by
the Savior in Matt. 13:14, 15 in such a way as to show
that the people were responsible for their hardness
of heart. When people will not believe the truth, God
sends them strong delusions that they may believe a
lie and be damned. (See 2 Thess. 2:8-12.) The reason
there are so many fool notions believed now is because
people will not believe the truth. God will have
all men to be saved, but they will not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>2. &ldquo;Did the crucifixion of Christ depend upon the
Jews&rsquo; rejection of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus came at a time when everything was ready
for the working out of God&rsquo;s plans. &ldquo;But when the
fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born
of a woman, born under the Law.&rdquo; (Gal. 4:4). God was
not experimenting to see if his plans would work out.
He knew what would be done, and was not bothering
his mind as to what he would have to do about it, if
the Jews did not reject and crucify Jesus, for he knew
what they would do. Then why should I worry my
mind about it? I cannot entertain an idea that implies
that God did not know enough to know when to send
his Son, or that he did not know what would happen
when he did send him. Why people raise such questions
is a puzzle, for no one can do anything about it,
no matter what might or might not have happened.</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;Did God anticipate their acceptance universally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suppose he did or did not, what can we do about it?
People raise questions that, in various ways, reflect
on God. Being the all-wise God, he knew that the Jews
would not all accept Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of
God. Jesus himself said that only a few would find
the narrow way. Paul showed that the prophets taught
that only a remnant of Israel would be saved. (See
Rom. 10:16-21; 11:1-10.) But what gives rise to such
questions? It grows out of the new speculation that
Jesus came to establish an earthly kingdom, or rather
to restore the kingdom of Israel, but failed in his
purpose because the Jews rejected him. God knew the
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
Jews would crucify Jesus. (See Acts 2:23; 4:27, 28;
13:27.)</p>
<p>4. &ldquo;If they had, would he have set up an earthly
kingdom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is not the least indication that God did not
accomplish what he intended to accomplish by sending
his Son into the world, nor that the kingdom he
set up was not what he intended to set up. On the other
hand, there is plenty of evidence that he inaugurated
the very system he had in mind, and which he had
foretold through the prophets. To say that his plans
did not work out as he intended is equal to saying that
the things he foretold through the prophets turned
out to be false. If it be replied that the prophets said
nothing about what some call &ldquo;the church age,&rdquo; it only
shows that some people have read the Scriptures with
little profit. The evidence is abundant that the apostles
and other inspired preachers and writers taught
that Christianity, or the gospel plan of salvation, is
exactly what the prophets foretold. On Pentecost,
Peter referred to certain prophecies as fulfilled on that
day. Again: &ldquo;Yea and all the prophets from Samuel
and them that followed after, as many as have spoken,
they also told of these days.&rdquo; (Acts 3:24.) In preaching
the gospel of Christ, Paul said nothing but what
the prophets and Moses did say should come. (Acts
26:22.) Paul also affirms that the gospel which he
preached God had &ldquo;promised afore through his holy
prophets in the holy scriptures.&rdquo; (Rom. 1:2.) But why
offer more proof? The apostles knew what they were
talking about, or rather the Holy Spirit, who spoke
through them, knew. Yet the future-kingdom advocates
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
generally contend that the Old Testament prophecies
center in an earthly kingdom, and say nothing
about Christianity as revealed through the apostles.
One writer said: &ldquo;But the Old Testament knows nothing
whatever of Christianity.&rdquo; Ponder this question:
If God did not set up the kingdom which they say the
prophets foretold, but instead gave them something
the prophets said nothing about, is it any wonder that
the Jews rejected it? The wonder would be that any
of them accepted it.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">Notice the prayer of Asa; notice other prayers in the
Bible. With the exception of Solomon&rsquo;s prayer at the dedication
of the temple and the prayer of Jesus on the night
of his betrayal, all are very short. Notice the manner in
which they addressed Jehovah. No endearing terms are
used, but terms expressive of reverence for the power and
majesty of God. Such expressions as &ldquo;our dear heavenly
Father&rdquo; are not found in the Bible. Such expressions should
have no place in our prayers today. Christians need to
know how to pray, and a study of the prayers of the Bible
will help us to pray as we ought.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree
on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall
be done for them of my Father who is in heaven.&rdquo; (Matt.
18:19.) Here it is supposed that they agree on what to
ask for before they pray. Would it not be a good thing
for a group of worshippers to know what they are going
to pray for, rather than for someone to lead out in a long,
rambling prayer that is supposed to be appropriate to all
occasions, and is, therefore, never appropriate to any occasion?
Delivering an oration to the Lord, under pretense
of praying, is not praying at all.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">THE OLIVE TREE FIGURE OF ROM. 11</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I wish you would give an explanation of Rom. 11. The
part that I am the most interested in is the figure of the
olive tree. Is there anything in this chapter, or in any
other, that teaches that the Jews as a nation will ever
accept Christ?&mdash;Oklahoma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We cannot at present give space to a discussion of
the entire chapter. The verses containing the olive-tree
illustration read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou,
being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst
become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of
the olive tree; glory not over the branches: but if thou
gloriest, it is not thou that barest the root, but the root
thee. Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that
I might be grafted in. Well; by their unbelief they were
broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not high-minded,
but fear: for if God spared not the natural
branches, neither will he spare thee. Behold then the goodness
and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity;
but toward thee, God&rsquo;s goodness, if thou continue in his
goodness: otherwise thou shalt be cut off. And they also,
if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in:
for God is able to graft them in again. For if thou wast
cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and
wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree;
how much more shall these, which are the natural branches,
be grafted into their own olive tree? (Rom. 11:17-24.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Care should be used in dealing with another man&rsquo;s
illustrations and figures of speech. The language quoted
is an illustration of God&rsquo;s dealings with Jews and
Gentiles. Because of unbelief the Jews had been severed
from God&rsquo;s favor; by faith the Gentiles had been
brought into union with God. Neither Jew nor Gentile
has any special favors from God; the standing of each
depends on their faith. That is the point Paul is making,
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
and to make his illustration do service beyond the
point illustrated is to do violence to his language.</p>
<p>But what is the olive tree? It is God&rsquo;s favor. Read
the connection. The Hebrews had been in God&rsquo;s favor
all along till they were broken off because of unbelief.
Their fall, mentioned in verse 12, is the same thing as
this cutting off. But now, to both Jews and Gentiles
alike, God&rsquo;s favor is manifested in Christ, and may be
obtained by faith in him.</p>
<p>No people as a nation will or can accept Christ. Any
people as a nation must act as an organized government;
those in authority determine what shall be done.
But no constituted authorities can decide that the nation
shall accept Christ; that is an individual matter.
But even if a nation could through its proper authorities
accept Christ, the Jews could not do so, for they
have no one with authority to speak for the whole people
on anything.</p>
<p>It is hard for some to see that God totally and finally
rejected and destroyed the Jewish nation, but
did not irrevocably reject the Jews. Paul gives himself
as an example that God had not irrevocably cast off
the Jewish people. That he referred to himself as an
example shows that he had in mind the Jews as individuals
and not as a nation. His case shows that the
door of salvation had not been closed against the individual
Jew. And his olive-tree illustration shows that
he was speaking of the individual Jew and not of the
nation. Both Jews and Gentiles were grafted into the
same olive tree, and both by the same process. Paul&rsquo;s
conclusion&mdash;&ldquo;and so all Israel shall be saved&rdquo;&mdash;has
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
been greatly perverted. The future-kingdom folks put
the emphasis on <i>all Israel</i>; Paul put the emphasis on
<i>so</i>. <i>So</i> is an adverb of manner. He had been showing
how the Jews might be saved, and not that the nation
would be restored. He had shown that Gentiles were
grafted in by faith&mdash;saved by faith in Christ. &ldquo;And
so&rdquo;&mdash;in like manner&mdash;shall all Israel be saved. Peter
had made the same point before the Jerusalem brethren:
&ldquo;But we believe that we shall be saved through
the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they.&rdquo;
(Acts 15:11.)</p>
<p>How many Jews may yet be converted to Christ, no
one knows; but those who are converted to Christ will
be in the one body with all converted Gentiles, &ldquo;where
there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision,
barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman;
but Christ is all, and in all.&rdquo; (Col. 3:11.)</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">Much is said about preaching the truth in love, and
so it should be preached. But in love of what? The preacher
should so love the truth that he will not sacrifice any of
it nor pervert it, and he should so love people that he will
not withhold from them even an unpleasant truth. He that
does either of these things loves neither the truth nor the
people. We frequently fool ourselves; we think we do
thus and so to spare the feelings of others, when it is our
own feelings that prompt us. &ldquo;Preach the word; be urgent

<p>The dispensations are referred to as ages. There
have been the Patriarchal age and the Mosaic age, and
also we now have the Christian age. The ends, or aims,
of both the Patriarchal age and the Mosaic age looked
forward to the Christian age. Christianity is the end
of the ages&mdash;it is the last. Yet the future-kingdom
advocates would have us believe that Paul was mistaken;
that Christianity is not the end of the ages, but
there will be at least two more ages. But Paul, being
inspired, was right, and Christianity is the end of the
ages. And that settles the future-kingdom claims. This
is the ends of the ages.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Here am I; send me.&rdquo; To know the Lord and to realize
our dependence upon him makes us willing, even anxious,
to do whatever he wants us to do. There is something fearfully
wrong with the heart of one who inquires concerning
any duty. Will it pay? Is it pleasant work? Will I be
thrown with the right sort of people? Will it enhance my
reputation? Is the work below my dignity? The true
servant of the Lord, like Isaiah, says: &ldquo;Here am I; send
me.&rdquo; Like his Lord he can say, &ldquo;My meat is to do the will
of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.&rdquo; (John

<p>The Scriptures do not tell us who or what the four

translated <i>living beings</i> or <i>living ones</i>. But that does
not tell us who or what they represent. If the querist
will read on through the sixth chapter, he will find
some of the things these living beings did. For one
thing he will find that they had the power of speech.
But the person who tells who or what they represent
tells that which he does not know to be true. Brother
Chumbley can find preachers who will tell him, and
he will also find that they do not agree.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">A tragedy, to have any unity of action when played

at all. Yet the tragedy of the trial and crucifixion of Jesus
was so written by the prophets. And then the play&mdash;none

<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">POINTS IN REVELATION 12</span></h2>
<p>A letter of some length from a good sister, Mrs. L.
E. Jones, tells about some things that came up in a
class of which she is a member. The teacher holds to
the future-kingdom theory. The class is going through
the book of Revelation. The letter mentions several
things that came up in their study of Chapter 12, and
from the letter I glean the following questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Is the accuser of verse 10 the devil? Is it because of
this accuser that Christ intercedes for us? It was so stated
by a member of the class, who also said that as God was
not human, he did not know what Christ suffered. Is that
true?</p>
<p>2. Our teacher said that God was protecting and keeping
the Jews, and that he had something special in store
for them (something nice). I want you to answer in the
Gospel Advocate as soon as convenient.</p>
<p>3. Does the woman of verses 1-6, 13-17 represent the
Jews? That was our teacher&rsquo;s idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1. From what is said in the context it seems clear
that the devil was before God as the accuser of the
brethren; but as he was cast down from heaven to the
earth, how can anyone figure out that he is now before
God accusing the brethren? He is, however, doing all
he can to lead them into sin. Hence, the admonition:
&ldquo;Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as
a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may
devour.&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:8.) He is busying himself here on
earth now. Jesus is our advocate with the Father, but
I would not think he was before God engaged in a
talk contest with the devil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>2. As God is no respecter of persons, how can any
believer in Christ argue that a Jew, because he is a
Jew, is yet to enjoy blessings that a Gentile cannot
hope to receive, no matter how faithful he is, simply
because he is not a Jew. The theory contradicts the
fundamental principles of the gospel. Those who hold
to that theory judge after the flesh&mdash;a thing Jesus
condemned. (John 8:15.) The theory encourages the
Jew to glory in his fleshly descent from Abraham&mdash;to
glory after the flesh. Such glorying Paul said was
foolishness. (2 Cor. 11:17, 18.) It teaches the Jew to
have confidence in the flesh, his Jewish flesh. Paul
had no such confidence; to him such relationship was
but refuse. Or, as the King James Version has it, he
counted such dependence on Jewish flesh as but dung.
(Phil. 3:2-8.) Such is your teacher&rsquo;s theory. Christ
died for all. (2 Cor. 5:15.) Now notice the next verse
(verse 16): &ldquo;Wherefore we henceforth know no man
after the flesh.&rdquo; Notice the force of the word <i>henceforth</i>&mdash;from
now on. Yes, the Jews are still in the
world; so are the Japanese and Chinamen. So what
does that prove? The person who assumes to know
what God knows or does not know is about like a worm
assuming to know what Solomon knew and did not
know.</p>
<p>3. Any theory about the woman of chapter 12 is
merely a guess, for the record does not say who she
was. Some commentators, perhaps the majority of
them, say she was the church, the dragon was the Roman
Empire, and the child was Constantine. I do not
know. But if the woman was the Jewish nation and
the child was Jesus, then she was a very unnatural
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
mother, for she killed her child! But that leaves the
dragon out of the picture, and leaves us wondering
about verse 6.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<h4>CREATING A DEMAND</h4>
<p class="bq">Sometime ago a Christian man asked a gospel preacher:
&ldquo;Why do we not have great gospel sermons like those we
used to hear?&rdquo; The reply was: &ldquo;There is no demand for
them.&rdquo; Do that question and answer reveal conditions as
they are? Have we reached the point where preaching is
trimmed down to fit the demands of the times? Is preaching
thus reduced to a matter of trade?</p>
<p class="bq">Some factories make only those articles that are in demand.
But occasionally an article is offered for sale for
which there had been no demand, but the makers of such
articles proceed to create a demand. They do extensive
advertising; they extol the uses and virtues of their article
till people want it. And cannot we in the same way create
a demand for the pure gospel in communities where there
is no demand? We cannot do it by dealing in religious
soup. There is a demand for the unadulterated gospel, for
great gospel sermons; but the demand is not as extensive
nor as intensive as it should be. Even in some churches of
Christ there is not as strong demand for gospel sermons
as there should be. When an elder can say, as some of
them have said, &ldquo;So far as I am concerned, I do not care
whether our preacher can preach or not,&rdquo; it is time we were
waking up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">QUESTIONS ON REVELATION 20.</span></h2>
<p>E. B. Taylor asks seven or eight questions on the
twentieth chapter of Revelation. To give answer to all
these questions would require an exegesis of the chapter.
For me that is impossible. The chapter abounds
in figures of speech. Many have read into that chapter
things that are not in it. They also make some of
it figurative and the rest literal, as the needs of their
theory require. With them a day in some of the prophecies
is a year, but they take the thousand years as
literal. Yet they will not say that the devil is a real
snake, nor that the chain is a literal chain, nor that
the beast is a real four-footed animal. Here are some
of the things in this chapter that I do not know: Who
the angel is, what the key is, the great chain, why the
devil is called a snake, what the binding means, the
thousand years, when the thousand years end, the
abyss and how it was sealed, length of the &ldquo;little
time,&rdquo; who sat on thrones, what judgment was given
them, the extent of that judgment, what the beast is,
the image, mark of the beast, the war of verse 8, Gog
and Magog, the camp of the saints, how devoured by
fire, the lake, the beast of verse 10, who the false prophet
is, nor how there can be day and night in eternity.
Yet the chapter makes some plain statements.</p>
<p>We may not know who the martyrs are, yet it is affirmed
of them, and of no one else, that &ldquo;they lived,
and reigned with Christ a thousand years.&rdquo; When or
where this reigning is, was, or is to be, is not stated.
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
But it is stated in verse 6 that those who have part
in the first resurrection &ldquo;shall be priests of God and
of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.&rdquo;
Hence, they are to be priests and to reign at the same
time&mdash;a royal priesthood. It is plain that they were to
reign while they were priests, but Christians are
priests now. Leaving out <i>to be</i>, words supplied by the
translator, Revelations 1:6 reads thus: &ldquo;He made us
a kingdom, priests unto his God and Father.&rdquo; Being
kings and priests, Christians are a royal priesthood.
(See 1 Pet. 2:9.)</p>
<p>In 20:12, John saw the dead standing before the
throne. <i>The dead</i>, not a part of the dead. This is in
perfect harmony with the Savior&rsquo;s description of the
judgment in Matt. 25:31-46. It is argued by some that
this is a judgment of nations&mdash;kingdoms&mdash;instead of
individuals. But nations in the Greek is neuter; but
the pronoun <i>them</i> in verse 32 is masculine, and, therefore,
refers to people, and not to nations as such. At
the judgment, therefore, all&mdash;the small and the great&mdash;will
stand before the throne. This is also made clear
in 2 Thess. 1:7-10. There it is declared that Jesus will
take vengeance on the wicked &ldquo;when he shall come to
be glorified in his saints.&rdquo; And the last verse in the
twentieth chapter of Revelations shows that some will
be at that judgment, whose names are written in the
book of life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">SEVERAL QUESTIONS</span></h2>
<p>1. Do you believe in the &ldquo;secret rapture&rdquo; theory?</p>
<p>2. Will there be any life on the earth during the millennium
period?</p>
<p>1. The word <i>rapture</i> is from a Latin word that
means &ldquo;to carry off by force.&rdquo; By some strange aberration
some religious folks applied that term to the
Lord&rsquo;s taking saints from the earth, as if they will
have to be forced to go or somebody or power will have
to be forced to let them go&mdash;a sort of seizing and carrying
away. But I could not believe in the &ldquo;secret rapture&rdquo;
unless I had some evidence. That evidence is
lacking.</p>
<p>2. I have found no evidence that there is to be a
thousand-year period in which there will be no life
on the earth. There is evidence, however, that there
will be life on the earth so long as the earth continues.
&ldquo;While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest,
and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day
and night shall not cease.&rdquo; (Gen. 8:22.) A careful
reading of 2 Pet. 3:1-14 will show that so long as the
earth remaineth Christians are exhorted to be &ldquo;looking
for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day
of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire
shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with
fervent heat.&rdquo; Any student can find other evidence
to the same import.</p>
<p>But suppose one believes the affirmative of both
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
these questions, what is practical about such belief?
If you hold to a notion that helps neither your faith
nor your practice, why waste time with it? Why disturb
others with it?</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">Jesus came to save sinners, not to make sinners. People
were sinners before Jesus came, and they would have
continued to be sinners had not Jesus come. If people do
not believe in him, they continue sinning just as they would
have done had he not come.</p>
<p class="bq">Though Jesus was moved with compassion at the sight
of human suffering, his miracles of healing were not performed
primarily to relieve suffering. If that were so,
he would cure all sick folks even now, or cause that no one
would ever be afflicted in any way. His miracles were
performed as signs that God was with him.</p>
<p class="bq">Jesus put a higher value on man than on animals.
&ldquo;How much then is a man of more value than a sheep!

<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">PREDICTION OR PROPHECY</span></h2>
<p>The word &ldquo;predict&rdquo; comes from a compound Latin
word that means, &ldquo;to say,&rdquo; or &ldquo;tell before&rdquo;; hence, to
prophesy. But many words in the course of time have
somewhat changed in meaning; &ldquo;predict&rdquo; is such a
word. In giving synonyms under &ldquo;foretell&rdquo; Webster
says, &ldquo;&lsquo;Foretell&rsquo; (Saxon) and &lsquo;predict&rsquo; (Latin) are often
interchangeable; but predict is now commonly used
when inference from facts (rather than occult processes)
is involved.&rdquo; Hence when a man considers facts
and trends and draws a conclusion as to what will be
the outcome, that is prediction. Did Bible prophecies
originate that way? No; &ldquo;... knowing this first, that
no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation.
For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but
men spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;
(2 Pet 1:19-21).</p>
<p>Verse 21 really explains verse 20. Prophecy was
never a forecast of events based on conditions and
trends of the times; it was not a private interpretation
of the culmination of trends. It did not come (Greek,
&ldquo;was not brought&rdquo;) by the will of man; &ldquo;but men
spake from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;
Hence, no prophecy came as a result of a man&rsquo;s own
private interpretation of trends and events of the
times. If a man should draw a conclusion from facts
and trends, such conclusion could, in a loose sense, be
called a prophecy, a prophecy of private interpretation,
a prophecy that came by the will of man; but
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
Peter speaks of the prophecy of scripture. Such prophecy
is not of the private interpretation of facts and
trends. Notice the contrast&mdash;&ldquo;no prophecy of scripture
is of private interpretation ... but men spoke
from God, being moved by the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The passage
has no reference to what should be done about
prophecy that had already been written, but to weave
together a mass of prophecies, most of which have
been fulfilled, and make a scheme for the future, practically
amounts to a man-made prophecy&mdash;a prophecy
that comes by the will of man. Even the prophets did
not understand their own prophecies&mdash;did not know
but that &ldquo;the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that
should follow them, &ldquo;was meant for themselves,&rdquo; till
God revealed to them &ldquo;that not unto themselves, but
unto you did they minister these things&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:10-12).
But it seems that a host of preachers and editors
today think they know more about the prophecies
than did the prophets who uttered them.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">A privilege is a right which we may exercise or not,
as we choose. Attending the annual feasts of the Jews
was a privilege with the women. They could stay at home
or go, without guilt. To the men, attending these feasts
was not a privilege, but a duty. To fail brought guilt.
Christians should do some serious thinking to determine
their privileges and their duties. To say that a certain
thing is both a privilege and a duty is about as sensible as
to say that a certain thing is both black and white. To be
baptized, to attend the Lord&rsquo;s-day worship, to give, to
study God&rsquo;s word, and to obey all other commands are duties,
and are not privileges in any proper sense of the word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">PROPHECY</span></h2>
<p>A prophecy is anything God reveals through an
inspired spokesman. It might be concerning future
events or present duties and warnings. But in this
article I shall use the word in its common acceptation&mdash;namely,
as a revelation of things future as to the
time the prophecy was given.</p>
<p>It was no uncommon thing for prophecies to be delivered
in highly figurative language. In such cases
the prophecy was to be fulfilled in the sense conveyed
by the figurative language. It is a common saying that
the Bible means exactly what it says, but that is never
true when things are spoken in figurative language.
We all use figurative language. When Paul said, &ldquo;Beware
of the dogs,&rdquo; no one thinks he referred to literal
dogs. When Jesus called Herod a &ldquo;fox,&rdquo; he used figurative
language, and no one thinks he meant that
Herod was a literal fox.</p>
<p>In his recent book on prophecy a certain brother
says: &ldquo;Expect a literal fulfillment. This is God&rsquo;s way
of fulfilling prophecy. Every prophecy which the Bible
says has been fulfilled has been fulfilled literally.&rdquo;
That is a broad statement. Can he make proof? Let
him try his dictum on Isa. 40:3, 4: &ldquo;The voice of one
that crieth, Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of
Jehovah; make level in the desert a highway for our
God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain
and hill shall be made low; and the uneven shall
be made level, and the rough places a plain.&rdquo; A literal
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
fulfillment of that prophecy would require mountains
and hills to be torn down and valleys to be filled up.
Now, Luke (3:4, 5) quotes this prophecy and applies
it to the work of John the Baptist. And Matthew distinctly
says that John the Baptist was the one of whom
Isaiah prophesied. (Matt. 3:3). This one fulfillment
of prophecy completely upsets his dictum, unless the
author contends that John had a contract to construct
a literal highway, and literally leveled mountains and
hills and filled up valleys, as highway builders do. But
we had never thought of John the Baptist as a road
contractor!</p>
<p>Another highly figurative prophecy is the following:
&ldquo;And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the
leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and
the young lion and the fatling together; and a little
child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall
feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the
lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child
shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child
shall put his hand on the adder&rsquo;s den. They shall not
hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth
shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters
cover the sea.&rdquo; (Isa. 11:6-9). But we are told that this
must have its literal fulfillment, and that the time
will come when all beasts of prey shall be thoroughly
changed and gentled. If all prophecies must be literally
fulfilled, what about the first verse of this chapter?
Will a literal shoot and branch come up from the
literal stock and roots of Jesse? And Isaiah (55:12)
spoke of a coming time when &ldquo;the mountains and the
hills shall break forth before you into singing; and all
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
the trees of the field shall clap their hands.&rdquo; And
we are gravely admonished to expect a literal fulfillment
of all prophecies!</p>
<p>But what about the animals? The kings of Assyria
and Babylon are called &ldquo;lions.&rdquo; (Jer. 4:7; 50:17.) The
princes in Jerusalem were called &ldquo;roaring lions,&rdquo; and
the judges &ldquo;wolves.&rdquo; (Zeph. 3:3.) The princes of Israel
were called &ldquo;whelps,&rdquo; and their mother &ldquo;a lioness&rdquo;;
and one of these whelps became a lion! (Ezek. 19:1-9.)
David referred to certain of his enemies as &ldquo;bulls&rdquo;
(Ps. 22:12), and Amos refers to certain people as
the &ldquo;kine of Bashan&rdquo; (Amos 4:1). Jesus called certain
people &ldquo;wolves&rdquo; (Matt. 7:15; 10:16), and Paul
said to the elders of Ephesus: &ldquo;Grievous wolves shall
enter in among you, not sparing the flock&rdquo; (Acts 20:29).
Will the future-kingdom advocates contend that
this prophecy of Paul&rsquo;s was literally fulfilled? Had
our brother been present, would he have looked for
literal wolves to destroy that church? If so, he would
have missed the force of Paul&rsquo;s words entirely. If
these elders had been guided by the above dictum, they
would have gone out on a literal wolf hunt!</p>
<p>Men of ferocious disposition are to be tamed and
gentled by the gospel of Christ; but even that will not
be universal, so far as this prophecy indicates. The
prophecy does not make any affirmation concerning
the whole world. The key to a proper understanding of
the prophecy which is quoted above is found in the last
verse: &ldquo;They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge
of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.&rdquo; It is in Jehovah&rsquo;s
holy mountain where this gentleness shall be&mdash;where
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
no hurt shall be done. The mountain of Jehovah,
in Isaiah&rsquo;s language, refers to Jehovah&rsquo;s government:
&ldquo;And it shall come to pass in the latter
days, that the mountain of Jehovah&rsquo;s house shall be
established on the top of the mountains, and shall be
exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto
it. And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and
let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house
of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways,
and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go
forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.&rdquo;
(Isa. 2:2, 3.) It is in this holy mountain, this
church, or house, of God, where &ldquo;they shall not hurt
nor destroy&rdquo;; and the reason is given: &ldquo;For the earth
shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters
cover the sea.&rdquo; Certainly no one will contend that
wild beasts will be so full of the knowledge of God that
they will not hurt nor destroy. But ferocious men do
become gentle under the influence of the gospel; they
must be thus gentled before they can enter Jehovah&rsquo;s
holy mountain.</p>
<p>One more thought. If, in studying prophecy, we are
to expect a literal fulfillment, and if that is God&rsquo;s way
of fulfilling all prophecies, then what are we to do
with Isa. 2:2, 3 and 40:3, 4? The mountains and hills
are to be leveled down, and yet Jehovah&rsquo;s mountain is
to be established on the top of the mountains and
exalted above the hills. How can both things take
place literally? So it appears that their dictum on the
literal fulfillment of prophecies makes it impossible
for prophecies to be literally fulfilled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">SHALL WE LOOK FOR A LITERAL FULFILLMENT OF ALL PROPHECY?</span></h2>
<p>The future-kingdom advocates put great stress on
the literal application of Old Testament prophecies. A
Prophecy concerning Israel must be applied to Israel
in the flesh, and Jerusalem means the Jerusalem in
Palestine. Zion must have its literal application, and
so with &ldquo;throne&rdquo; and &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo;, etc. With them,
there must be no &ldquo;spiritualizing.&rdquo; The lamb and the
lion must refer to literal lion and lamb. But will they
stick to that line? Hardly. Isaiah said: &ldquo;Every valley
shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be
made low; and the uneven shall be made level, and the
rough places plain.&rdquo; (Isa. 40:4.) Now, the inspired
historians of the New Testament applied that Scripture
to the work of John the Baptist; yet we are told
by the future-kingdom advocates that every prophecy
must have its plain, literal fulfillment. If so, the inspired
New Testament writers were mistaken on this
point, and that prophecy has not yet been fulfilled.</p>
<p>But we are told that the prophecies mean exactly
what they say. Now, is that really so? Then, what
about the four beasts in Daniel 7? &ldquo;Four great beasts
came up from the sea, diverse one from the other.&rdquo;
Yes, it is true that these matters were interpreted for
us, but it is also true that the interpretation shows that
the four beasts were not actually four beasts. It also
shows, as do other passages, that many prophecies are
couched in highly figurative language. The prophecy
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
concerning the work of John (Isa. 40) shows how
highly figurative some prophecies are. Or will the future-kingdom
folks say that even this prophecy must
yet have its literal fulfillment?</p>
<p>But it is contended that the throne of David means
the rule over the fleshly house of Israel in the land of
Palestine, and that unless Christ rules over the Jewish
nation in the land of Palestine he does not occupy the
throne of David. He must have a civil government,
with Israelites as citizens and the land of Palestine as
the territory; otherwise, he does not occupy the same
throne David did. This would imply that the kingdom
over which Christ rules must be an exact replica of
the kingdom as it was in the days of David. If not,
why not? If it can be changed in one particular, why
not in others? It is argued that God&rsquo;s oath to David
(Ps. 89:34, 35) precludes the possibility of any change
in the kingdom. But even after so arguing, do our
future-kingdom advocates outline a kingdom just like
the kingdom of David? They do not. Here are a few
points wherein the kingdom of David differs from the
future kingdom as outlined by its advocates:</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s reign was local; Christ&rsquo;s reign to be worldwide.</p>
<p>Every kind of Israelite, good and bad, citizens in
David&rsquo;s kingdom: only regenerated Israelites to be
citizens in Christ&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>Fleshly birth made citizens of David&rsquo;s kingdom; a
Jew must be born again to be a citizen of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Every child of Hebrew parents was in David&rsquo;s kingdom;
children must be old enough to voluntarily accept
Christ to be in the future kingdom.</p>
<p>David was king, family of Aaron were priests
then; Christ to be both King and Priest.</p>
<p>Some rather unruly men were helpers in David&rsquo;s
kingdom; only true and tried Christians are to reign
with Christ. (Here the future kingdom as outlined by
its advocates radically differs from David&rsquo;s kingdom.)</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s kingdom was constantly beset by its enemies;
no enemies to the future kingdom.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s kingdom constantly organized for war;
nothing like that in the future kingdom.</p>
<p>In David&rsquo;s kingdom they learned war; in the future
kingdom they shall learn war no more.</p>
<p>David reigned while the devil was loose and doing
his worst; we are told that Christ cannot begin his
reign till Satan is bound.</p>
<p>Moses was the lawgiver of the old kingdom; Christ
is to be the lawgiver for the future kingdom.</p>
<p>And that is not all; but we grow weary of the task of
enumerating the differences. Yet we are told that, if
there is any alteration, the throne of the kingdom cannot
be the throne of David.</p>
<p>When Jehovah called Israel out of Egypt, he told
them that, if they would obey his voice, they would be
unto him &ldquo;a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.&rdquo;
(Ex. 19:5, 6.) But had not God always exercised universal
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
dominion over all the works of his hands? Certainly,
but now he was to rule in a special way over a
special people. As this people were to have no earthly
head, they were not to be like the nations around them,
and were not to be reckoned among the Nations. God
made their laws, and gave direction for their execution.
This state of things continued till the days of Samuel.
Then the people asked for a king that they might be
like the nations around them. That was a rejection of
Jehovah as their king. Saul was put on the throne,
and the kingdom became his. He was rejected and the
kingdom given to David. These men and the descendants
of David occupied the throne that belonged
peculiarly and specially to Jehovah. Jehovah occupied
that throne before Saul or David, and that throne continued
after the last son of David reigned. The royal
family of David fell into decay, but did Jehovah&rsquo;s rule
over Israel cease? Did not his throne continue as it did
before Saul became king? It is true that the Jews
were rarely independent, but were they any less under
the rule of Jehovah when they were subject to other
nations? Did not the kingdom continue with them?
Before becoming excited at these words, read Matt.
21:43: &ldquo;Therefore say I unto you, the kingdom of God
shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a
nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.&rdquo; How could
the kingdom be taken from them, if it was not then
with them? The Lord was then developing that nation
to whom the kingdom was to be given, and to whom it
was given on the first Pentecost after his resurrection.</p>
<p>On Pentecost, Peter preached that God had raised
up Jesus to sit on David&rsquo;s throne. It has been argued
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
that Peter does not say that he then sat upon that
throne. If not, what point was there in mentioning it?
After mentioning it, Peter says: &ldquo;Being therefore by
the right hand of God exalted,&rdquo; etc. If that is not a
conclusion from what he said about the throne of
David, why the &ldquo;therefore&rdquo;? Would Peter&mdash;would
any speaker&mdash;make an argument about the throne of
David, and conclude that &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; Jesus had been
exalted to something else, something he had not even
mentioned? Are we seriously expected to believe such
absurdities?</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>

<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">ABRAHAM AND THE LAND PROMISE</span></h2>
<p>When God called Abraham out of the Chaldees, he
made certain promises to him, one of which is this: &ldquo;In
thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.&rdquo;
(Gen. 12:1-3). Then when Abraham stood the test
about offering up Isaac, God added this to the other
promises: &ldquo;In thy seed shall all the nations of the
earth be blessed.&rdquo; That this promise refers to Christ
is made clear by Paul: &ldquo;Now to Abraham were the
promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And
to seeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed,
which is Christ.&rdquo; (Gal. 3:16). Paul&rsquo;s language shows
clearly that the promised seed of Abraham was none
other than Christ Jesus. It is a perversion of the
promise to make it refer to all fleshly children of
Abraham or to those who are children by faith. Christians
are blessings to others only as they allow Christ
to use them as his instruments.</p>
<p>Universalists use the promise to Abraham in an
effort to prove that all people will be saved, but they
ignore the conditionality of promises. It is not my
purpose to discuss Universalism, but call attention to
these statements: &ldquo;Ye will not come to me, that ye
may have life.&rdquo; (John 5:40). &ldquo;He that disbelieveth
shall be condemned.&rdquo; (Mark 16:16). &ldquo;And these
shall go away into eternal punishment.&rdquo; (Matt. 25:46).
A person who will not believe these scriptures,
and others that might be cited, will not believe anything
he does not want to believe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The future kingdom folks have twisted the land-promise
in support of their future plans for the Lord.
The land-promise to Abraham did not produce the
speculation about the future return of the Jews to
Palestine; but their return is an essential part of the
future kingdom theory, and that made it necessary to
claim that the land promise still holds good. Let us
look into this matter briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto
thy seed will I give this land.&rdquo; (Gen. 12:7). &ldquo;And
he said unto him, I am Jehovah that brought thee out
of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit
it.&rdquo; (Gen. 15:7). But Abram did not believe Jehovah,
and said, &ldquo;O Lord Jehovah, whereby shall I
know that I shall inherit it?&rdquo; For that unbelief, God
required him to prepare three animals and two birds
for a sacrifice, and then Jehovah did not honor his
sacrifice with fire from heaven; and Abram had to
protect his sacrifices from birds of prey. Then he fell
into a deep sleep; &ldquo;And lo, a horror of great darkness
fell upon him.&rdquo; Then Jehovah revealed to him the
future bondage of his seed, and their deliverance. This
showed Abram how God was displeased with Abram&rsquo;s
unbelief. It is significant that God left Abram out of
his next promise: &ldquo;In that day Jehovah made a covenant
with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given
this land.&rdquo; You see, Abram would have died long before
they returned from Egypt. As we proceed it is
well to remember the wording of this covenant-promise,
and that Abraham is not included in it. Yet
so long as Abraham lived, he was included in the land
promise. (See Gen. 17:8). And of course, when the
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
land-promise was made to Isaac and to Jacob after
the death of Abraham, he was not included (Gen.
26:2, 3; 28:13).</p>
<p>It is urged by some that God promised the land to
Abraham as an individual, yet Stephen says that God
&ldquo;gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to
set his foot on.&rdquo; (Acts 7:5). It is affirmed that this
promise must yet be fulfilled; yet Abraham had all the
grazing rights he needed. The land therefore was his
to use. But the future kingdom advocates overlook
another statement Stephen made: After mentioning
Israel&rsquo;s going down into Egypt, Stephen said, &ldquo;But as
the time of the promise drew nigh which God vouchsafed
unto Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in
Egypt.&rdquo; (verse 17). This was the land promise which
God made to Abraham&mdash;&ldquo;God vouchsafed unto Abraham.&rdquo;
The time for the fulfilling of that promise to
Abraham had drawn nigh. The language cannot be
twisted to mean anything else: So the Lord led Israel
out of the land of Egypt and into the land of Canaan.
Was this land promise which was &ldquo;vouchsafed to Abraham,&rdquo;
and which had drawn nigh fulfilled? Joshua
answers that question. &ldquo;So Jehovah gave unto Israel
all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers;
and they possessed it, dwelt therein.... There failed
not aught of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken
unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.&rdquo; (Josh.
21:43-45). In his farewell address Joshua said, &ldquo;And,
behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth:
and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls,
that not one thing hath failed of all the good things
which Jehovah your God spake concerning you; all are
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
come to pass unto you, not one thing hath failed
thereof.&rdquo; (Josh. 23:14). Language could not be
plainer; or more emphatic. And a man who will not
believe what Joshua says will not believe anything he
does not want to believe.</p>
<p>We have been told that the land promise was unconditional;
but the fact that the Jews were carried
into captivity because of their sins and the further fact
that they are not now in Palestine, and also the fact
that at the beginning they had to drive the nations out,
show how foolish it is to say that the land promise was
not conditional. The Jews increased in their wickedness
till they crucified Christ and tried to destroy his
church. For these crimes they lost the land and their
national existence; and now they have no more right
to Palestine than to Italy, or any other country.</p>
<p>Notice the wording of God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham:
&ldquo;I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the
land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an
everlasting possession.&rdquo; (Gen. 17:8). &ldquo;After thee&rdquo;&mdash;does
that preposition &ldquo;after&rdquo; mean any thing to you?
The land was given to Abraham, and to his seed after
him&mdash;a succession of ownership, first Abraham and
after him his seed. So if that promise is yet to be fulfilled,
then Abraham will first occupy the land, how
long no one knows, then it passes to his seed. Look at
the language carefully, and it will mean something to
you. You cannot ignore that preposition &ldquo;after.&rdquo; It
is clear enough if you recognize the fact that Abraham
had full use of the land while he lived, and that after
him his seed had the land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">THE TIME OF PROMISE</span></h2>
<p>In the discussion about the land promise made to
Abraham, one plain statement seems to have been
overlooked. But, first, let us get before us an argument
that some make on that promise. It is argued
that the promise was made direct to Abraham and was
meant to be fulfilled to him in person, and yet Stephen
informs us that God &ldquo;gave him none inheritance in it,
no, not so much as to set his foot on.&rdquo; (Acts 7:5).
Assuming that the promise to Abraham meant that
he would have title and right to the land in his own
person, it is therefore argued that he must yet have it
in his possession. It is therefore argued that the Jews
must return to Palestine, so that the promise to Abraham
may be fulfilled. But in thus making Abraham
and the nation of Israel joint-owners of the land at the
same time&mdash;they overlook the promise as Stephen
stated it: &ldquo;and he promised that he would give it to
him in possession, and to his seed after him.&rdquo; Notice
that word <i>after</i>&mdash;first to Abraham, then to &ldquo;his seed
<i>after</i> him.&rdquo; Notice again this word <i>after</i> in Gen. 17:8
&ldquo;I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the
land of thy sojourning, all the land of Canaan.&rdquo;
Abraham first, then his seed after him. I wonder how
long these future kingdom folks think Abraham is to
possess the land before it comes into the possession
of his seed after him! The emphasis the future kingdom
folks place on their idea that the land was to be
given to Abraham in person will not allow them to
concede the truth that the promise was made to him
as the head or father of a nation to be possessed by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
nation of whom he was the father. The head or father
of a nation is sometimes put for the nation&mdash;is
sometimes spoken of as a nation. Before Jacob and
Esau were born, Jehovah said to Rebecca, &ldquo;Two nations
are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated
from thy bowels: and the one people shall be
stronger than the other people; and the elder shall
serve the younger.&rdquo; (Gen. 25:23). These statements
or promises concerning these unborn sons were to be
fulfilled centuries after they were born&mdash;fulfilled in
their descendants. To rebellious King Saul, Samuel
said, &ldquo;Jehovah hath rent the kingdom of Israel from
thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine,
that is better than thou.&rdquo; (1 Sam. 15:28.) Yet that
threat was never visited upon Saul in person, for he
continued to be king so long as he lived. Now, that
threat to Saul was as personal as was the land promise
to Abraham. Why does not some wild scribe argue
that Saul must be raised again and put on the throne
of Israel, so God can fulfill his threat?!! The threat
was fulfilled in the family of Saul just as the land
promise to Abraham was fulfilled to his descendants.
And that is exactly the way the land promise to Abraham
was fulfilled. After Stephen spoke of this land
promise, he said, &ldquo;But as the time of the promise drew
nigh which God vouchsafed unto Abraham, the people
grew and multiplied in Egypt.&rdquo; (Acts 7:17.) &ldquo;The
time of the promise&rdquo; can mean nothing else than the
<i>time for the fulfillment of the promise</i>. That time had
drawn nigh, and things began to shape up for the fulfillment
of that promise. Those who claim that the
promise has not yet been fulfilled have a quarrel with
Stephen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>At the proper time Moses was sent to lead Israel
out of Egypt. In giving instructions concerning the
passover, Moses said, &ldquo;And it shall come to pass, when
ye are come to the land which Jehovah will give you,
according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this
service.&rdquo; (Ex. 12:25.) Hence when they should come
into their possessions in Canaan, that was exactly what
God had promised. Again Moses refers to Canaan as
the land which Jehovah &ldquo;sware unto thy fathers to
give thee.&rdquo; (Ex. 13:5.) This same promise is referred
to many times in Deuteronomy. A few of the many
passages: (6:3, 10, 18, 23; 8:1; 31:20.) These passages
teach plainly that the possession of the land of
Canaan by Israel would be the fulfillment of the land
promise made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Joshua
so understood it; for when the tribes of Israel came
into possession of the territories allotted them, he
said, &ldquo;And behold this day I am going the way of all
the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all
your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the
good things which Jehovah your God spake concerning
you: all are come to pass unto you, not one thing
hath failed thereof. And it shall come to pass, that as
all the good things are come upon you of which Jehovah
your God spake unto you, so will Jehovah
bring upon you all the evil things, until he have destroyed
you from off this good land which Jehovah
your God hath given you.&rdquo; (Josh. 23:14, 15.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">REBELLION OF ISRAEL&mdash;A KINGDOM BORN.</span></h2>
<p>When Jehovah led the Israelites out of Egyptian
bondage, he said to them, &ldquo;Ye have seen what I did
unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles&rsquo;
wings, and brought you unto myself. Now therefore,
if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant,
then ye shall be mine own possession from among
all peoples: for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be
unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.&rdquo; (Ex.
19:4-6.) Of course, God, in a general way, ruled over
all the works of his hands, but in a special sense he
ruled over the nation of Israel. For a long time Jehovah
was their only king. In emergencies he raised
up judges to deliver them from their enemies. But in
the course of time they became dissatisfied with that
sort of thing. Their sins brought them into trouble,
and they thought that it was the efficiency of the governments
surrounding them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves
together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah; and they
said unto him, Behold thou art old, and thy sons walk
not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like
all the nations. But the thing displeased Samuel, when
they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel
prayed unto Jehovah. And Jehovah said unto Samuel,
Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they
say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but
they have rejected me, that I should not be king over
them.&rdquo; (1 Sam. 8:4-7.) Nevertheless, Jehovah told
Samuel to inform the people fully as to how the king
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
which they desired would oppress them, and Samuel
did so. &ldquo;But the people refused to hearken unto the
voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have
a king over us, that we also may be like all the nations,
and that our king may judge us, and go out before
us, and fight our battles.&rdquo; (Verses 19, 20.) Saul
was selected as king, though some were not pleased
with the selection.</p>
<p>Soon after being made king, Saul smashed the armies
of the Ammonites in a great battle. Then Samuel
knew that it was an appropriate time to gather the
people together and &ldquo;renew the kingdom.&rdquo; They were
called together at Gilgal, and there Samuel resigned
as judge in a solemn address to the people. He told
them that, although they had asked for a king when
Jehovah was their King, Jehovah would bless them and
their king, if they and their king obeyed his voice. His
speech and the rain that came at Samuel&rsquo;s call so impressed
the people that they said: &ldquo;We have added
unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.&rdquo; (1 Sam.
12:19.)</p>
<p>This kingdom, which was conceived in a desire to
be like other nations, born in open rebellion against
God, and tolerated through the forbearance of God, is
the kingdom that some people would have us believe
God yet intends to restore and enlarge. That kingdom
restored is, we are told, the hope of Israel! That is the
kingdom over which Jesus and the church will yet rule,
and through which all the world will be blessed! Who
can believe it?</p>
<p>I am aware that a question like this may occur to
some one: If that kingdom was established in rebellion
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
against God, how is it that Jehovah promised the
throne of David to the Christ? But if we were unable
to give a satisfactory answer to that question, it would
not change what the Lord says as to the spirit that
brought that kingdom into existence. But the question
presents no real difficulty. Before the people
called for a king so as to be like the nations, Jehovah
was their king; he alone occupied the throne. Of course
you understand that &ldquo;throne&rdquo; means authority to rule,
rulership, kingly authority. When Saul, David, or Solomon
ruled over God&rsquo;s people, he occupied the throne
of Jehovah. It was called David&rsquo;s throne because he
occupied it, and not because it was his by right. If
people could ever get it settled in their minds that
David really sat on Jehovah&rsquo;s throne, it would save
them from some confusion. But these two quotations
show that the throne of David and the throne of Jehovah
are the same: &ldquo;And Solomon sat upon the throne
of David his father.&rdquo; (1 Kings 2:12.) &ldquo;Then Solomon
sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David
his father.&rdquo; (1 Chron. 29:23.) It is plain that Jehovah&rsquo;s
throne was called David&rsquo;s because he occupied
it. He who rules over God&rsquo;s people occupies the same
throne that David occupied. No one will deny that
Jesus now rules over God&rsquo;s people or, if you like the
expression better, rules in the hearts of God&rsquo;s people.
To acknowledge that he does so rule is to acknowledge
that he sits on the throne on which David sat. This
truth has nothing to do with the fact that the people
of Israel sinned in wanting a king so as to be like
the nations around them. &ldquo;I have given thee a king in
mine anger, and have taken him away in my wrath.&rdquo;
(Hos. 13:11.)</p>

<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">NEITHER&mdash;NOR</span></h2>
<p>In the May issue of Word and Work, Stanford Chambers
writes under the above caption as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One was recently heard to say publicly: &ldquo;I am neither
a premillennialist nor a postmillennialist.&rdquo; I think I saw
the same from the pen of some writer. It is difficult to
see how one can avoid being one or the other. A man might
say: &ldquo;I am neither an immersionist nor a nonimmersionist.&rdquo;
How could that be, unless he disregards baptism entirely?
Just so in regard to the return of our Lord; it is
either before the millennium, that is, premillennial, or it is
after it, that is, postmillennial. Whoever disavows the
event of his coming until the close of the millennium, whoever
puts the millennium anywhere preceding the coming,
is a postmillennialist, whatever he disavows or denies.</p>
<p>Just because the Lord Jesus may come at any time, and
because it is an event he has commanded us to watch for
and to pray about, I dare not put a thousand years between
me and the fulfillment. Hence, I am a premillennial,
and can no more help it than I can help being an immersionist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what difference does it make whether I am &lsquo;pre&rsquo;
or &lsquo;Post&rsquo;?&rdquo; I should say not enough in and of itself, merely,
for it to be made a test of fellowship as has been attempted
even by some &ldquo;Neither ... Nor&rsquo;s.&rdquo; But it might
make a great deal of difference for a man to put a thousand
years between him and the coming of Jesus. Our Saviour
himself shows the likely effect for one to say: &ldquo;My
Lord delays his coming.&rdquo; Again, it might make a great
deal of difference for him to teach men so. It is a serious
thing to oppose any one&rsquo;s quoting, &ldquo;The Lord is at hand,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;The Judge standeth before the door,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The end of
all things is at hand,&rdquo; or &ldquo;When ye see these things, know
that he is near.&rdquo; Too much store is being set by this &ldquo;what
difference does it make?&rdquo; The postmillennial error has
many attendant malinterpretations it were well to avoid.
As every truth of God&rsquo;s word is helpful, so every error
is harmful, and <i>any</i> error <i>may</i> lead to fatality. &ldquo;Prove all
things, hold fast that which is good.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I have said publicly, both orally and in print,
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
that I am neither a premillennialist nor a postmillenialist.
The Gospel Advocate has been all along
making a heroic effort to steer clear of all party, or
class, names. But Brother Chambers thinks it cannot
be done. He does not see how a man can keep from
being a premillennialist or a postmillennialist. In his
estimation a man cannot be simply a Christian; he
must have some sort of a descriptive term to designate
what sort of Christian he is. And so we have premillennial
Christians and postmillennial Christians. Here,
then, is partyism in religion, the beginning of new
denominations. It will not help the situation any to
say that these are merely descriptive words, and not
party names. Why the need of these descriptive terms,
if they are not intended to describe different parties?
<i>Methodist</i> was first a descriptive term, and then a
party name. Premillennial Christian, postmillennial
Christian, and Baptist Christian; in principle, what is
the difference? And herein we see one of the evils of
preaching speculative theories that create groups,
classes, or parties in the church. What right has any
man or set of men to create two parties, and then tell
me that I must belong to one of them? That these
brethren of Word and Work have created conditions
that make it necessary in their judgment to use descriptive
terms to designate groups of brethren condemns
the whole movement as divisive in nature and
sectarian in principle. If they think they have created
conditions in the church that make it necessary for the
Gospel Advocate to line up with one of these parties
and be labeled, they are decidedly mistaken. If, as
Brother Chambers says, he cannot help wearing a
party label, he needs the help the Gospel Advocate is
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
trying to give him. But if he is just bound to be what
he is, and cannot help it, what will he do about it when
the Lord comes, if the Lord does not follow the program
these brethren have marked out for him? And
herein is another danger to these brethren. Before
Jesus came to earth, the learned Jews had things
mapped out; and because Jesus did not follow their
program, they believed him to be an imposter. Yes,
there were program makers for his first coming, and
there are program makers for his second coming; and
the fatal blunder of the first program makers should
be a warning to the present program makers.</p>
<p>But Brother Chambers thinks that neither &ldquo;pre&rdquo;
nor &ldquo;post&rdquo; should be made a test of fellowship. There
is something pitiful and shaky about a plea that one&rsquo;s
teaching or practice be not made a test of fellowship.
The plea itself is a confession of divergence. We have
often heard that same plea from the &ldquo;progressives.&rdquo;
No matter from whom it comes, it sounds like a plea
for forbearance and mercy. The Gospel Advocate has
never, in its long history, felt the least need of making
such a plea. Can you imagine J. C. McQuiddy, T. B.
Larimore, E. G. Sewell, or David Lipscomb begging
the brethren not to make some theory or practice of
theirs a test of fellowship?</p>
<p>There has been a good deal of loose talk about tests
of fellowship. To raise the question as to an opinion
or theory without giving any attention to what is done
with the opinion or theory does not meet the issue. An
opinion or practice might be very innocent, and yet a
man might make a great deal of trouble with it. It is
not then his opinion you must consider, but the use he
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
makes of it. Suppose some man should decide that
dark clothing is conducive to piety and sober-mindedness,
and that light clothing makes the wearer light-hearted
and gay, and that flashy dress makes the
wearer frivolous and giddy. Would you feel disposed
to make his notion or his practice a test of fellowship?
But suppose that peculiar notion of his becomes such
an obsession with him that he feels that he must advocate
it everywhere? He becomes so carried away
with the idea that he becomes a nuisance, a trouble
maker, and a divider of churches; what then? What
would Brother Chambers do about it? Suppose he,
while dividing churches with his peculiar theory,
pleads that the sort of dress a fellow wears should not
be made a test of fellowship; how would Brother
Chambers answer him? It is supposed, of course, that
Brother Chambers cares enough for the peace and
unity of churches to do something about such a situation,
but what would he do? Would he fellowship the
fellow, bid him Godspeed, and call him to hold meetings?
And it would be much worse if the fellow divided
churches by preaching hurtful and untrue
theories.</p>
<p>If brethren press a theory to the dividing of
churches and then tell us that we must let them alone,
else they will have no fellowship with us, what can we
do about it? They have drawn the line, and issued a
&ldquo;manifesto.&rdquo; And yet they keep talking about tests
of fellowship.</p>
<p>What is their object in talking so much about tests
of fellowship? Do they live up to their plea? When
has a church which indorses whole-heartedly the Word
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
and Work theory ever called one who opposed such
theory to hold their meeting? What fellowship do
they extend to preachers who do not indorse them?
Why do they not call Foy E. Wallace, Jr., C. R. Nichol,
or men like these, to assist them in meetings? No
longer ago than last year some friends of mine wanted
me to teach a Bible class of nights in their meetinghouse.
Two of the elders are ardent admirers of
Brother Boll and his teaching; they refused to allow
the class to be taught in the meetinghouse. Look at
the matter any way you please, and it was worse than
a refusal to fellowship me. And the only grounds of
refusal was the fact that I was not a &ldquo;pre.&rdquo; Now,
until they show some fellowship toward those who
oppose their theories, all clear-thinking brethren will
conclude that their talk about &ldquo;tests of fellowship&rdquo; is
indulged in merely to create prejudice in their favor.
Such a thing is cheap politics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Savior himself shows the likely effect for one
to say: &lsquo;My Lord delays his coming.&rsquo;&rdquo; Brother Chambers
here quotes from the parable found in Luke
12:42-48. These brethren quote, &ldquo;My Lord delays
his coming,&rdquo; as if that was the real crime of that
wicked servant; whereas he merely took advantage of
his lord&rsquo;s delay to give expression to the villainy that
was already in him. The use these brethren make of
this seems to indicate that they think the only thing
that keeps people out of all meanness is the expectation
that the Lord might come any moment. But I have
never said that the Lord delays his coming, and, therefore,
do not belong in the class with that wicked servant.
The word translated <i>delayeth</i> means &ldquo;<i>to linger</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
<i>delay</i>, <i>tarry</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Thayer. &ldquo;<i>To spend time</i>; <i>to continue</i>
or <i>last long</i>, <i>hold out</i>; <i>to persevere</i> in doing; especially,
<i>to tarry</i>, <i>linger</i>, <i>delay</i>, <i>be slow</i>; <i>to prolong</i>, <i>put off</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;Liddell
and Scott. This word would not be used concerning
an event that was not delayed beyond the time
it was expected. Now, these future-kingdom advocates
tell us that the first Christians were taught to
expect Jesus to come again while they lived. But he
did not come then. According to their teaching, the
Lord has delayed his coming several hundred years
beyond the time expected. Who is it that says the
Lord did not come at the time he was expected? They
are the ones, according to their own teaching, who
say: &ldquo;My Lord delays his coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brother Chambers says: &ldquo;It is a serious thing to oppose
any one&rsquo;s quoting, &lsquo;The Lord is at hand,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The
Judge standeth before the door,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The end of all
things is at hand,&rsquo; or &lsquo;When ye see these things, know
that the end is near.&rsquo;&rdquo; Who opposes his quoting the
Scriptures referred to? When a man makes an implied
charge of that nature, he is honor bound to name
the parties, when called on to do so. Will Brother
Chambers give the name of the person to whom he refers,
or is he merely insinuating things to create prejudice?</p>

<p class="bq">To write the word of Christ upon the heart, or, what

<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">FUTURE KINGDOM DOCTRINE&mdash;REFLECTS ON INTEGRITY OF GOD</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes a wrong theory does not look so bad till
you begin to examine its consequences and the side
issues that are its necessary supports. And sometimes
theories so warp our thinking as to develop in us a
wrong conception of Jehovah and of his attitude
toward man. Such theories are extremely hurtful.
There are some things about this future-kingdom
theory that are hurtful in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The Theory Reflects on the Integrity of God.</p>
<p>In his tract, &ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; page 13,
Arthur W. Pink says: &ldquo;From a number of reasons
which we shall state we are compelled to believe that
our Lord&rsquo;s message, &lsquo;Repent; for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand,&rsquo; signifies that <i>an offer of the
Messianic kingdom</i>, as foretold by the Old Testament
prophets, <i>was then being made to the Jews</i>. Let us
remark that it is of the utmost importance that we pay
careful attention to the word &lsquo;repent&rsquo; here. In this
call to repentance, our Lord, as the Baptist before him
had done, <i>laid down the fundamental terms on which
the kingdom was being offered to Israel</i>.&rdquo; Others
make the same plea. If they are correct, then God
offered them the kingdom on condition that they repent.
Thousands of them did repent; but we are told
that God deferred the establishment of the kingdom
because not all repented. But what about his promise
to them who did repent? God made them a promise on
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
condition; they performed that condition, but God did
not give them what he promised! It does not help any
to say that the nation rejected him. What about his
promise to those who accepted him? It will not do to
say God dealt falsely with some because others dealt
falsely with him. We are told that the offer of the
kingdom was made in good faith. Some accepted the
offer in good faith, but we are told that they did not
get what God had promised them. There is a serious
defect in a man&rsquo;s faith who can thus reflect on the
integrity of Jehovah.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">Grubbing up false doctrines and unscriptural practices
is as essential as grubbing up noxious growths in the field,
but a farmer can impoverish himself by putting in all his
time grubbing. And the man who puts in all his time in
opposing false doctrine and exposing wrong practices will
impoverish his character. The fundamental doctrine, or
teaching, is the framework around which the Christian
character is built. The framework must be there, or the
character will not stand up; the gentler graces must be
built around the framework, or the person is harsh and unattractive.</p>
<p class="bq">Every time we judge a doctrine or another person, we
judge ourselves. In condemning evil, we declare ourselves
righteous. In condemning righteousness, we declare our
sinfulness. In other words, every judgment we deliver
shows what sort of person we are. Our judgments on
others reveal our own standards. The character of the
Jews was revealed in their blaspheming the gospel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHETS AND CHRISTIANITY</span></h2>
<p>In his kingdom tract, page 15, Mr. Arthur W. Pink
says: &ldquo;The Old Testament <i>knows nothing whatever of
Christianity</i>!&rdquo; So, then, there is not a type or a
prophecy in the Old Testament that points to the religion
of the Lord Jesus Christ! But that idea is not
peculiar to Mr. Pink; it is a part of the future-kingdom
doctrine. To the ordinary reader of the New Testament
it sounds strange to hear some one argue that
the prophets of the Old Testament tell us nothing
of the gospel of Christ, the New Covenant (or New
Testament), the kingdom as it now is, or anything
else that pertains to the present plan of salvation
through Christ. But such teaching is one of the
necessary supports to the future-kingdom theory. It
must be made to appear that the entire plan of God
for the world&rsquo;s redemption centered in a material
kingdom, in which the Jews would be the citizens and
over which Jesus would rule on the throne of David in
Jerusalem. It would be the kingdom of David literally
restored. Other nations would be blessed only through
Israel and in subservience to them. Of course the
theory contemplates the return of the Jews to Palestine
and their conversion to Christ. And we are
taught by the future-kingdom advocates that the Old
Testament prophets speak only of that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Let the reader think closely as he reads the following
quotation: &ldquo;About the middle of Acts occurs an event
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
of first importance. The acceptance of the Gentiles
into the church&mdash;into the favor of God as joint sharers
of the blessings of Israel&rsquo;s Christ&mdash;was a most terrible
perplexity to all believing Jews. It was, in fact, a
<i>mystery</i>. It had never been revealed that such a thing
would happen. (Eph. 3:4-6.) That the Gentiles were
to be blessed in Messianic days was no mystery; <i>that</i>
had been previously revealed. But the observant reader
of the prophets will notice that it is always after the
national restoration and exaltation of Israel, and always
through restored Israel and in subservience to
Israel that the Gentiles were to be so blessed.&rdquo; (&ldquo;The
Kingdom of God,&rdquo; by R. H. Boll, page 63.) So they
would have us believe that the Old Testament prophets
said nothing of the gospel as revealed in the New
Testament, nothing of the new covenant of which the
apostles are ministers and of which Christ is mediator,
and that the covenant of which Jeremiah prophesied
(chapter 31) has not yet been made. Yet Paul quotes
that prophecy in the eighth chapter of Hebrews, and
informs us that Christ is now the mediator of that
covenant.</p>
<p>But the theory is wrong, absurdly wrong. In Luke&rsquo;s
record of the great commission (24:46, 47) Jesus said:
&ldquo;Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and
rise again from the dead the third day; and that repentance
and remission of sins should be preached in
his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.&rdquo;
Here Jesus plainly declares that it had been
written that repentance and remission of sins should
be preached in his name unto all the nations. Paul
declares that he had been &ldquo;separated unto the gospel
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
of God, which he promised afore through his prophets
in the holy scriptures.&rdquo; (Rom. 1:1, 2.) Here Paul
plainly declares that the gospel which he preached had
been promised through the prophets. In reporting
Paul&rsquo;s preaching at Berea, Luke says: &ldquo;Now these
were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that
they received the word with all readiness of mind,
examining the scriptures daily, whether these things
were so.&rdquo; (Acts 17:11.) How could they determine
that Paul was preaching in harmony with the prophets,
if the prophets said nothing of the gospel which
he preached? In that case, would not their searching
the Scriptures cause them to reject his preaching? If
Paul had held to the future-kingdom theory, his honesty
would have led him to tell these honest-hearted
Bereans that they could not find anything in the Scriptures
about the gospel which he was preaching. At
the house of Cornelius, Peter said: &ldquo;To him bear all
the prophets witness, that through his name every
one that believeth on him shall receive remission of
sins.&rdquo; (Acts 10:43.) Peter (1 Pet. 1:10-12) tells us
that the prophets searched diligently to understand
their prophecies concerning this salvation, &ldquo;To whom
it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto you,
did they minister these things, which now have been
announced unto you through them that preached the
gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from
heaven.&rdquo; Paul preached the gospel&mdash;preached Christianity
in its fullness, and yet he affirmed that he
said &ldquo;nothing but what the prophets and Moses did
say should come.&rdquo; (Acts 26:22, 23.) He preached salvation
through faith in Christ, and that there was no
distinction between Jew and Gentile: &ldquo;But now apart
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested,
being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus
Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction.&rdquo;
(Rom. 3:21, 22.) So this very plan of salvation
which Paul preached, in which there was no
distinction between Jew and Gentile, was foretold in
both the Law and the prophets. Paul quotes Moses as
prophesying that disobedient Israel would be provoked
to jealousy by the obedience of a people other than
the Jews. (Rom. 10:19.) Paul applies that prophecy
to the obedience of the Gentiles. And then he shows
that Isaiah foretold that the Gentiles would be blessed
while Israel remained rebellious: &ldquo;And Isaiah is very
bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me
not; I became manifest unto them that asked not of
me. But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I
spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying
people.&rdquo; And yet we are told that the prophets
foretold that only through restored Israel were the
Gentiles to be blessed.</p>

<p>Much is said these days about modernism and fundamentalism.
I hope to be allowed to live in a modern
world without being called a &ldquo;modernist&rdquo; and to hold
to fundamental truths without being dubbed a &ldquo;fundamentalist.&rdquo;
These &ldquo;fundamentalists&rdquo; have formed
a program for the Lord, mixed in a few truths, and
named the mixture &ldquo;fundamentalism,&rdquo; and its advocates
&ldquo;fundamentalists.&rdquo; If their theory is as old as
the Bible, why the new names for it and its advocates?
Old ideas and doctrines do not require new names:
anything new requires a new name. Now, &ldquo;modernism&rdquo;
and &ldquo;modernist&rdquo; are older words than &ldquo;fundamentalism&rdquo;
and &ldquo;fundamentalist.&rdquo; Religiously, I am
no &ldquo;modernist&rdquo;; and the term &ldquo;fundamentalism&rdquo; is
too new for a Bible lover to accept. It is even newer
than the term &ldquo;modernism.&rdquo; It would be interesting
to hear Mr. Rice explain how his doctrine is so ancient,
since the name of it is more modern than is the
term &ldquo;modernism.&rdquo; In name, they out modern the
modernists! When a doctrine is more modern than
modernism, it is too modern for me.</p>
<p>In Mr. Rice&rsquo;s tract, &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s Literal Reign on Earth
from David&rsquo;s Throne at Jerusalem,&rdquo; he claims to prove
&ldquo;from the Scriptures the premillennial coming of
Christ; that he has not yet set up his kingdom on
earth, but that he will reign from a literal throne at
Jerusalem, in his literal human body, over the entire
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
earth.&rdquo; He assumes much, argues little, and makes
many scattering assertions. It would be easier to review
his tract, if more care and thought had gone into
its making.</p>
<p>The trouble with him and his future-kingdom advocates,
is not speculating about unfulfilled prophecies,
but a perversion and dislocation of prophecies
that have been fulfilled. When a man takes prophecies
that have been fulfilled and makes them do service
in some future program, he is not speculating about
unfulfilled prophecies. To call such perversion &ldquo;speculation
about unfulfilled prophecies&rdquo; is to yield to him
his claim that they have not been fulfilled. This is not,
therefore, a discussion on &ldquo;unfulfilled prophecies,&rdquo; but
an effort to show that Mr. Rice and others have, in
the interest of a theory, dislocated promises and prophecies,
some of which have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Mr. Rice quotes Gen. 13:14, 15; 17:8, and comments:
&ldquo;You will notice from the context that it was the literal
land over which Abraham walked and which he
saw, called by the name, &lsquo;the land of Canaan.&rsquo; The
promise is unconditional, and utterly without time limit.
It is &lsquo;for an everlasting possession&rsquo;.&rdquo; And if Mr.
Rice will read Josh. 21:43-45; 23:14, he will notice
both from the text and the context that God fulfilled
this promise to the letter&mdash;not one thing failed of all
that God had promised. Yet the Jews are not in that
land now. Why? Mr. Rice says the promise of the
land to Abram&rsquo;s seed was unconditional and without
time limit. Who broke the covenant? If Mr. Rice is
correct, the seed of Abraham did not break the land
covenant, for there were no conditions for them to
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
break. If Mr. Rice is correct, God was the only one
that could break the covenant. God promised them
unconditional possession of the land, and then dispossessed
them of it. That is a reflection on the integrity
of Jehovah.</p>
<p>Mr. Rice says: &ldquo;The Lord foretold in Deut. 28:63-68
the dispersion of Israel &lsquo;among all the peoples,
from one end of the earth even unto the other;&rsquo; but in
Deut. 30:1-6, the regathering of Israel to their own
land to possess it is plainly foretold.&rdquo; Why did Mr.
Rice refer to so small a part of each of these chapters?
Was he afraid the reader might discover something
in the rest of these chapters that would upset his
theory? Their dispersion was one of the curses that
would come upon them if they disobeyed the law Moses
gave them. (See Deut. 28:15.) Read Deut. 30:8, 10,
and you will see that their return was conditioned on
their keeping the commandments which Moses commanded
them, and that after their return they were
to keep all the commandments of the law of Moses.
This condition is now impossible of fulfillment, for
the law of Moses is not in force. If Mr. Rice will read
Neh. 1:8, 9, he will find that the regathering here
spoken of took place when the Jews returned from
Babylonian captivity. Surely he will not take issue
with Nehemiah. The other passages relied on to prove
the future gathering of the Jews to Palestine refer
to the same event.</p>
<p>Moses plainly told the Israelites that if they forgot
God and turned from his commandments, they would
as surely perish as that the nations whom they drove
out of Palestine perished. (Deut. 8:19, 20.) These nations
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
perished utterly as nations, and Moses said the
nation of Israel would perish as they did. Because of
their sins they were carried into captivity. Later, all
who desired to return to Palestine were permitted to
do so. They again fell into sin; and in John&rsquo;s day they
had again grown so corrupt that he told them the ax
then lay at the root of the tree. (Matt. 3:10.) Then
the Jewish nation murdered the Son of God&mdash;that is,
the high court of the nation procured his murder. Under
God&rsquo;s law the penalty for murder was death. As
this was murder by the nation, nothing but national
death would satisfy divine justice. The tree had become
wholly bad, and God used the Roman armies as
the ax with which to cut down that tree. According to
these future-kingdom advocates, the most glorious
period of Jewish history is yet to be; but Jesus tells
us that the last state of that race will be worse than
the first. (See Matt. 12:43-45.)</p>
<p>The Jews were broken off from God&rsquo;s favor because
of sin&mdash;unbelief. Now both Jew and Gentile
stand on an equal footing before God. God is not a
respecter of persons. Religiously, we know no man
after the flesh. These future-kingdom folks seek to
keep up this racial distinction which Christianity was
meant to destroy. In Paul&rsquo;s allegory (Gal. 4:21-31)
the handmaid and her son represented Jerusalem and
the Jewish nation, and Paul uses that allegory to show
that the handmaid and her son were cast out. Christians
are children of the free woman. Paul then affirms:
&ldquo;The son of the handmaid (Jewish nation)
shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.&rdquo;
Hence, the Jewish nation, as such, is left out of any
further inheritance. Jesus plainly told the Jews:
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
&ldquo;Therefore say I unto you, The Kingdom of God shall
be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing
forth the fruits thereof.&rdquo; (Matt. 21:43.) Believers
in Christ are now &ldquo;sons of Abraham&rdquo; (Gal. 3:7)
&ldquo;and heirs according to the promise&rdquo; (Gal. 3:29). The
Jewish nation, as such, is not now an heir of anything.
By unbelief the Jews were broken off from God&rsquo;s favor.
(Rom. 11:20.) Gentiles were grafted in by faith.
&ldquo;And so&rdquo;&mdash;in the same manner&mdash;&ldquo;all Israel shall be
saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is not a hint in the New Testament that the
Jews will be restored to Palestine and be the only citizens
of this fantastic future kingdom, with other people
subject to them. That would be fleshly distinction
with a vengeance. &ldquo;Behold, now is the acceptable
time; behold, now is the day of salvation.&rdquo; (2 Cor.
6:2.) Think of the nature of this kingdom these men
set forth as the object of our highest hope: &ldquo;The kingdom
of Christ is to be as literal as David&rsquo;s kingdom....
It is to be as literal and earthly as Babylon,
Medio-Persia, Greece, and Rome.&rdquo; So says Mr. Rice.
That would please well the carnal nature of man. It
is a pitiful thing to see men delude themselves with
such false hopes.</p>
<p>Mr. Rice says: &ldquo;Jesus, David&rsquo;s son, is to restore
David&rsquo;s kingdom.&rdquo; Yet he says: &ldquo;The present world
system will have to be destroyed before Christ can
have his kingdom on this earth.&rdquo; David ruled without
having the present world system destroyed. If Christ
is to have the same kingdom, why cannot he do the
same? Is it possible that Mr. Rice thinks David could
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
do a thing that Christ will be unable to do? The theory
belittles Christ.</p>
<p>Here are two statements from Mr. Rice: &ldquo;Jesus will
restore all Israel to their own land, the land of Canaan,
and will rule over them from David&rsquo;s throne.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Jesus is not now sitting in his throne, but in his Father&rsquo;s
throne, according to Rev. 3:21.&rdquo; His idea is
that when Jesus comes again he will descend from
that universal throne which he now occupies with the
father and sit on David&rsquo;s throne as king of the Jews,
thus exchanging a higher for a lower. And they call
that exaltation of Christ! Exalted to a lower place!
&ldquo;Throne&rdquo; means kingly authority. David&rsquo;s throne and
Jehovah&rsquo;s throne are the same. In I Kings it is said
that &ldquo;Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father.&rdquo;
In 1 Chron. 29:23 it is said that &ldquo;Solomon sat
upon the throne of Jehovah as king instead of his
father.&rdquo; That which was called David&rsquo;s throne was
Jehovah&rsquo;s throne. It was called David&rsquo;s throne simply
because he ruled over God&rsquo;s people. The effort to
make a distinction between God&rsquo;s throne and David&rsquo;s
throne is a miserable perversion of Bible truth. As
Jesus now rules over God&rsquo;s people, he occupies the
same position that David occupied.</p>
<p>When did Jesus begin his reign? On Pentecost, Peter
reminded his hearers that God had promised David
to place one of his seed upon his throne, and that David,
foreseeing this, spoke of the resurrection of Christ.
Jesus was therefore raised up to sit on David&rsquo;s throne.
Read Acts 2:29-38. Verse 33: &ldquo;Being therefore by
the right hand of God exalted, and having received of
the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
poured forth this, which ye see and hear.&rdquo; To Peter
the coming of the Holy Spirit on that day was proof
that Jesus had been exalted to David&rsquo;s throne. From
John 7:37-39 we learn that the Holy Spirit would be
given when Jesus was glorified. Read Mat. 20:20, 21
and Mark 10:35-37, and you will see that sitting with
Jesus in his kingdom and sitting with him in his glory
mean the same thing. As the giving of the Holy Spirit
on the day of Pentecost was proof that he had entered
into his glory, it is also proof that he had been exalted
to rulership in his kingdom.</p>
<p>But it has been said that Jesus was then anointed,
but did not then begin to reign, just as David was
anointed some time before he began his reign. But
here is a fatal defect in that illustration: Not one
thing was done in the name of David as king till he
actually assumed the reins of government. Acts were
to begin to be performed in the name of Christ at
Jerusalem when the Holy Spirit came. (Luke 24:46-49.)
On that day Peter commanded the people to repent
and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
the remission of sins. (Acts 2:38.) Was Peter guilty
of forging the name of Christ to a pardon proclamation?
He had no right to so do, and his act was forgery,
if Jesus had not authorized him to do so. And
Jesus could not have authorized him to proclaim pardon
in his name, if Jesus was not then occupying the
throne. Not one future-kingdom advocate, nor all of
them together, can answer this one argument, neglected
or overlooked though it has been. It settles the
whole matter as to the fact of his reigning now and as
to when his reign began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Mr. Rice says: &ldquo;John the Baptist came preaching
&lsquo;Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rsquo;
(Matt. 3:2.) Jesus began to preach from the same
text in his early ministry. (Matt. 4:17.) We find that
the command to repent is repeated many times on
through the rest of the New Testament, but the statement,
&lsquo;The kingdom of heaven is at hand,&rsquo; was dropped
and not repeated any more, though the kingdom is
mentioned dozens of times. The reason is that the
Jews rejected Christ, their King, and the kingdom was
postponed. (Luke 13:34, 35.)&rdquo; &ldquo;At hand&rdquo; means
&ldquo;near.&rdquo; In the third year of his public ministry Christ
sent the seventy out to preach, &ldquo;The kingdom of God
is come nigh unto you.&rdquo; (Luke 10:1-10.) That was
during the last year of his ministry. Certainly, after
the first Pentecost after the resurrection the kingdom
was not preached as &ldquo;at hand&rdquo; any more, for the simple
reason that it had come. Paul says that Christians
have been &ldquo;delivered out of the power of darkness,
and translated into the kingdom of the Son of his love.&rdquo;
(Col. 1:13.) Christ is now &ldquo;The blessed and only Potentate,
the King of kings, and Lord of lords.&rdquo; (1 Tim.
6:15.) As he is the &ldquo;only Potentate,&rdquo; he alone rules
in this kingdom. Hence, it is his kingdom, and the
throne is his throne.</p>
<p>But Mr. Rice would have us believe that when John
and Jesus announced that the kingdom had come
nigh they missed it a long way. Jesus also preached
&ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of heaven is
at hand.&rdquo; (Mark 1:15.) If Mr. Rice is correct, the
kingdom was not at hand&mdash;the time for it to come
was not fulfilled. He would have us believe that Jesus
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
did not know what he was talking about. But that
is not the worst reflection on Jesus that this theory
makes. They were assured of the kingdom on condition
that they repent and believe the gospel&mdash;that is,
that they repent and accept Christ. Some of them, in
good faith, trusting the words of John and Jesus, did
repent, and accepted Christ. But, according to the adherents
of the future-kingdom theory, they did not
get what God had promised them. It will not relieve
the situation to say that most of them rejected him.
What about his word to those who did accept him?
They did their part; did God do his? Mr. Rice says
he did not. I am unalterably opposed to any theory
that thus makes out God a liar to those who faithfully
do his commands and trust his promises.</p>
<p>The postponement theory belittles the church and
makes it an afterthought, a sort of emergency measure.
According to Mr. Rice, God meant to establish
a material kingdom just like other world kingdoms,
but the Jews did not make it possible for him to do
so. The church was then established to continue till
the time was ripe for the kingdom, according to the
theory. The church, then, was not God&rsquo;s original plan.
But what saith the Scriptures? Was that God&rsquo;s original
intent? &ldquo;To the intent that now unto the principalities
and powers in the heavenly places might be made
known through the church the manifold wisdom of
God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed
in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; (Eph. 3:10, 11.)
Thus we see that it was the eternal purpose of God
to make known his wisdom through the church. And
how long will this continue? &ldquo;Unto him be the glory
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations
forever and ever.&rdquo; (Eph. 3:21.) The church, then,
will not be superseded by another institution so long
as generations come and go.</p>
<p>Mr. Rice quotes Acts 15:13-16 to prove that &ldquo;the
restoration of the kingdom of David is to be after this
Gentile church age.&rdquo; Had he given the full quotation
James made from Amos, it would have proved the
very opposite of what he claims. James was justifying
the acceptance of the Gentiles, and quoted Amos
to prove that since the royal family of David was re-established
the Gentiles might come into the church.
Read verses 17 and 18 and see how miserably Mr.
Rice perverts the argument of James.</p>

<h2 id="c28"><span class="small">YOUR FAITH AND YOUR CONFESSION</span></h2>
<p>The promises and prophecies recorded in God&rsquo;s revelation
to the Jews led them to confidently expect the
coming of a Deliverer, the Messiah. They have planted
that expectation in the hearts of many Gentiles. (Of
course the reader understands that &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; in Hebrew
is the same as &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; in Greek.) But the Jews
had no clear conception as to what the Christ would
be and do. In fact they had many very erroneous ideas
about the promised Christ. Hence, when Jesus appeared
in their midst, they were so blinded by their
theories that they rejected him as the Christ&mdash;that is,
the majority of the Jews would not accept him as the
Christ, while many of them believed on him as the
Christ. To the most of them Jesus was a puzzle, a
stone of stumbling. They could not deny his mighty
miracles nor controvert successfully his teaching. Denying
the only truth that would have explained him,
they dealt in many conjectures as to who he was. Some
said he was Elijah; some John the Baptist; others,
that he was Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. But
when Jesus put the question direct to his disciples,
&ldquo;But who say ye that I am?&rdquo; Peter unhesitatingly answered:
&ldquo;Thou art the Christ, the son of the living
God.&rdquo; But the majority of the Jews refused to believe
that Jesus was the Christ, and looked forward to the
coming of the Christ.</p>
<p>Upon the great truth that Jesus is the Christ the
church is built; upon that truth the whole system of
Christianity rests. If he be not the Christ, the gospel
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
is a baseless fabrication and the church is without excuse
for existence. It is this foundation truth that we
believe and confess.</p>
<p>There was no controversy among the Jews as to
whether the expected Christ would be called &ldquo;the Son
of God.&rdquo; Any Jew would confess that he believed the
expected Christ to be the Son of God. But they deny
that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God. Any of
those Jews who rejected and crucified Jesus would
have readily said: &ldquo;I believe the Christ is the Son of
God.&rdquo; I was startled to hear a preacher ask a number
of candidates for baptism this question: &ldquo;Do you believe
that Christ is the Son of God?&rdquo; Now that
question misses the point entirely. Any orthodox Jew
could give an affirmative answer to that question; but
ask him if he believes that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
of God, and he will answer with an emphatic &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
The great question is: &ldquo;Do you believe that Jesus is
the Christ, the Son of the living God?&rdquo; The great
answer, the great confession of faith is: &ldquo;Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That confession should not be so abridged as to
leave any doubt as to who you believe is the Christ, the
Son of God. If you believe that Jesus is the Christ,
say so. To say that you believe that Christ is the Son
of God is really no confession at all.</p>
<p>The confession should not be extended so as to include
more than this great truth. Mr. Russell extended
that confession. He taught that the Christ is
Jesus and the church; with him, Jesus was only the
head of a body that is called &ldquo;the Christ.&rdquo; With him,
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
it took both the head and the body to constitute the
Christ. Some gospel preachers took up with that idea
and thus weakened their faith by extending their confession.
Certainly, if a man believes that theory, his
confession is not full and complete when he says: &ldquo;I
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living
God.&rdquo; That is really not what he believes. If he
makes his confession as broad as his faith, he will
say: &ldquo;I believe that Jesus and the church is the
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do the foregoing points seem to you to be matters
of small import? If so, I envy not your discernment.
Notice carefully the purpose for which John wrote:
&ldquo;Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence
of the disciples, which are not written in this book:
but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus
is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye
may have life in his name.&rdquo; (John 20:30, 31.)</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;For ye were going astray like sheep.&rdquo; The idea expressed
in the original Greek is not that they were going
astray, but they were astray. When a living thing is
astray, it is lost; at least, it is not in its proper place, not
where it belongs. Sin is not the proper element for people;
they do not rightly belong there; it is not their natural
habitat. Righteousness is man&rsquo;s natural habitat; that
is where God originally placed him. When he wanders off
into sin, he is on foreign soil.</p>
<p class="bq">The Hebrew kingdom never would have been divided

<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">THE CHRIST OF THE FUTURE-KINGDOM ADVOCATES</span></h2>
<p>One of the great evils of the future-kingdom advocates
is their idea as to the Christ. When I first
read Pastor Russell&rsquo;s idea of the Christ, I was astonished,
but later I found that others had adopted his
idea. Mr. Russell says: &ldquo;Thus the saints of the gospel
age are an anointed company&mdash;anointed to be kings
and priests unto God (2 Cor. 1:21; 1 Pet. 2:9); and
together with Jesus, their chief and Lord, they constitute
Jehovah&rsquo;s Anointed&mdash;the Christ.&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Divine
Plan of the Ages,&rdquo; pages 81, 82.) Also &ldquo;The
Christ includes all anointed of the Spirit.&rdquo; Now note
the following from &ldquo;The Book of Revelation,&rdquo; by R. H.
Boll: &ldquo;That the man-child of chapter 12:5 is none
other than the Christ; but not the individual Christ
alone, but his body, the church, also, seen as connected
with him.&rdquo; Page 44: &ldquo;This mystic man-child
is not simply the Child that was born at Bethlehem,
but the Christ as including both himself, the head, and
the church, his spiritual body, which is one with him.&rdquo;
In the estimation of these writers the Christ is composed
of Jesus and the church. If a person espouses
that theory, he should make his confession as comprehensive
and extensive as his faith. If he says, &ldquo;I believe
that Jesus is the Christ,&rdquo; his confession is not
full. To fully confess his faith in the Christ, he must
say: &ldquo;I believe that Jesus and his church is the Christ.&rdquo;
That is evident to any one who will read carefully what
these writers say. Read the quotation again. Now,
shall we revise our confession to make it fit this
future-kingdom idea?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small">IS SALVATION NOW OFFERED TO ALL?</span></h2>
<p>A man does not always realize fully the consequences
of his doctrine. It seems to me that a person cannot
believe the future-kingdom theory as now advocated
and also believe that God now seeks the salvation of all
men. If I understand this theory, and I think I do,
the faithful Christians are to be rulers with Christ,
and that to each one will be given territory commensurate
with his development as a servant of God.
Some, at least, seem to take the parable of the pounds
(Luke 19:13-27) in a very literal sense. &ldquo;Have thou
authority over ten cities&rdquo;; &ldquo;Be thou also over five
cities.&rdquo; As there will be a limit to the number of cities,
there will, of necessity, be a limit to the number of
rulers needed. Mr. Russell was consistent and bold
enough to plainly and openly declare that God is not
now seeking to convert the mass of mankind, but is
only getting a ruling class ready. His position on this
point is so well known that I shall not here take space
to quote from him. Some do not speak so plainly
on this point as Mr. Russell, and yet they speak plainly
enough to be understood, as the following from
Brother R. H. Boll will show: &ldquo;That the &lsquo;new song&rsquo; of
Rev. 5:9, 10 views the work of purchasing unto God
with his own blood men out of every nation as finished.
The selection is seen as completed; the full number of
the chosen ones seen as constituting a kingdom of
priests unto God, as reigning on earth. This then
prophetically foreviews the time when God shall have
done visiting &lsquo;the Gentiles&rsquo; (the nations) to <i>take out
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
of them</i> a people for his name. (Acts 15:14.) The
church is an election, <i>called out</i>.&rdquo; Again: &ldquo;He has a
mystery&mdash;that is, a secret&mdash;to tell us: to wit, that
Israel&rsquo;s hardening is limited as to extent and as to
time: as to extent, for it is &lsquo;in part;&rsquo; as to time, for
it is &lsquo;until&rsquo; something is accomplished&mdash;namely, until
the full count of the elect Gentiles shall have come in.
Then Israel&rsquo;s tide shall turn.&rdquo; So it seems that the
Lord has a certain number of Gentiles to be called,
and the present order must continue till the &ldquo;full
count of the elect Gentiles shall have come in.&rdquo; But
all such teaching is essential to the future-kingdom
theory as now advocated. The theory necessitates the
doctrine that now is the time of salvation for only the
needed number of rulers.</p>

<h2 id="c31"><span class="small">THE COMING OF THE LORD</span></h2>
<p>In the Christian Standard of March 19, 1932,
Brother H. H. Peters, secretary of the Illinois Christian
Missionary Society, says: &ldquo;As already intimated,
the plan of the Millenial Harbinger was different from
that of its predecessor. It was unique in the journalism
of America, religious or otherwise. Its very
name indicates that its editor partook somewhat of
the spirit that was abroad in the land, which expected
the immediate return of the Lord and the establishment
of his millenial reign. Mr. Campbell never became
a dogmatist on this point, nor did the brotherhood
ever take up any of the fantastic views of Miller and
others, but it was impossible in that day to do any
kind of religious work without partaking somewhat
of the spirit that expected the immediate return of the
Lord.&rdquo; It would be hard to crowd into fewer words
more historic errors than the foregoing extract contains.
Mr. Campbell did not believe that Jesus would
return to earth and then reign a thousand years. He
did believe that, before the coming of the Lord, there
would be a thousand years of universal peace and
righteousness. Mr. Campbell was not a premillennialist;
neither did he believe the Lord would return
immediately. On these matters he wrote extensively.
He cited a number of prophecies which he believed
had not been fulfilled, but must be fulfilled before
the coming of the Lord. One wonders where Mr.
Peters got authority for his statements. However,
when a person gets intoxicated with the future-kingdom
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
idea, he can see authority for statements that no
sober-minded person can discover. They even tell us
that the apostles taught the early Christians to expect
the immediate return of the Lord.</p>
<p>Because some do not hold to the theories propagated
by the premillennialists, they are charged with not believing
in the second coming of the Lord at all. From
one writer we have the following: &ldquo;The thought of his
coming has faded out of the minds of men.&rdquo; Again:
&ldquo;In the eighteenth century, however, there came a man
named &lsquo;Daniel Whitby.&rsquo;... He taught that the gospel
would spread and spread until the whole world
would be converted; then would follow a thousand
years of blessedness and peace, and after all this Jesus
would come and wind things up. Then the hope of his
coming died again everywhere as this doctrine became
the general teaching.&rdquo; That is such a manifest misrepresentation
of the great body of Christians that I
shall make no attempt to disprove it. As Mr. Campbell
was accused of holding the same views as Whitby,
it will be seen that Mr. Peters misrepresents him in
the quotation at the beginning of this article.</p>
<p>We are told that &ldquo;they were hoping for him, and
they were looking for his return in the days of the
apostles.&rdquo; We are asked to believe that the Christians
began to expect his return any moment after he went
away, and that they were taught by the apostles to do
so. They think they find such teaching in what the
apostles said about looking for his coming and hoping
for his coming; but the theory discredits the inspiration
of the apostles. Jesus did not come again during
that period. If the apostles were mistaken on that
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
point, how can we be sure they taught the truth on
anything? If the infidel were to point to this as
evidence that the apostles were not infallible in their
teaching, how would these men meet the argument?
On this point the learned commentator, James McKnight,
says: &ldquo;Grotius, Locke, and others, have affirmed
that the apostles of Christ believed the end of
the world was to happen in their time, and that they
have declared this to be their belief, in various
passages of their epistles. But these learned men and
all who join them in that opinion have fallen into a
most pernicious error. For thereby they destroy the
authority of the gospel revelation, at least so far as it
is contained in the discourses and writings of the
apostles; because, if they have erred in a matter of
such importance, and which they affirm was revealed
to them by Christ, they may have been mistaken in
other matters also, where their inspiration is not
more strongly asserted by them than in this instance.
In imputing this mistake to the apostles, the deists have
heartily joined the learned men above mentioned, because
a mistake of this sort effectually overthrows
the apostle&rsquo;s pretensions to inspiration. It is therefore
necessary to clear them from so injurious an
imputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such use has been made of the parable recorded in
Luke 12:42-48 as to make it appear that the servant
was unfaithful, in that he said: &ldquo;My Lord delayeth his
coming.&rdquo; But they miss the point. As a matter of
fact, the Lord has delayed his coming far beyond the
time they tell us the inspired apostles said he might
come. There was certainly nothing sinful in what the
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
servant said, when it was true that his lord had delayed
his coming. There could be no unfaithfulness
in his saying what was actually true. But his unfaithfulness
consisted in his taking advantage of that delay
to do wrong. His wrong doing was his unfaithfulness.
Not what he said about that delay, but what he
did during that delay, constituted his unfaithfulness.
But their use of this parable illustrates the strained
interpretations men will put upon the Scripture to
propagate a theory.</p>
<p>But another statement in that parable has some
bearing on the matter under discussion: &ldquo;The lord of
that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not,
and in an hour when he knoweth not, and shall cut
him asunder, and appoint his portion with the unfaithful.&rdquo;
This statement applies to all unfaithful servants,
and not simply those who will be alive when the Lord
comes again. To make this apply only to those who
are alive at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming would leave
many unfaithful servants that would not suffer the
fate that this one did, for more shall have died before
the Lord comes again than will be alive when he does
come. It can apply to all unfaithful servants only in
the sense that the Lord comes to all at death.</p>

<h2 id="c32"><span class="small">THE &ldquo;TWO STAGES&rdquo; THEORY EXAMINED</span></h2>
<p>It would not be fair to myself nor to the reader to
charge that any Christian does not believe that the
Lord will come again. That event is so plainly taught
in the Bible that no one who believes the Book thinks
otherwise. But some have engaged in so much speculation
about what will occur when the Lord does come
that, so it seems to me, their theories virtually deny
much of what has already taken place. In some
respects the various angles of their theory fail to connect,
or even to harmonize.</p>
<p>I have a rather artistic diagram, prepared by a
Baptist preacher of some ability, in Houston, Texas.
In this diagram the Lord is represented as coming to
the air surrounding the earth, where he is met by the
living saints, now changed, and the dead saints, now
raised from the dead; and there the diagram represents
them as remaining some years, or during the
time of the &ldquo;great tribulation&rdquo; on earth, after which
they come on to the earth. Brother R. H. Boll has a
diagram in which he sets forth the same idea. The
coming of the Lord is thus represented as composed of
two &ldquo;stages&rdquo;&mdash;coming for his saints, and then coming
on to earth with his saints. But another angle to the
theory does not fit into this, as will be seen.</p>
<p>The theory has the Lord with his saints back in
heaven between the two &ldquo;stages&rdquo; of his coming. Because
we so represent matters, some, who do not consider
all the angles of the theory, say we are guilty of
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
serious misrepresentation. Let us not be too hasty.
There is another angle to this theory.</p>
<p>The theory represents the whole of the book of
Revelation from the beginning of the fourth chapter
to the close as dealing with things yet future, and that
from the beginning of chapter four to the end of chapter
nineteen it tells of things that will occur between
the &ldquo;two stages&rdquo; of the Lord&rsquo;s coming; and that is at
the time another angle of the theory has the Lord with
his saints in the air surrounding the earth. If a man
believes that Rev. 4:1 to chapter 19, inclusive, speaks
of what is to occur between the two &ldquo;stages&rdquo; of their
theory, he cannot believe that the Lord remains in the
air with his saints during that time. Brother Boll himself
does not so believe. &ldquo;To see these future things
John is called up to heaven. For it is in heaven that
the plans and counsels of God are laid; and the things
that transpire on the earth have their secret source
and origin there.... So all the great events of which
the book of Revelation tells come from above, first
decreed and decided on in God&rsquo;s council chamber in
heaven.&rdquo; John first saw God sitting upon his throne
surrounded by twenty-four other thrones, upon which
sat twenty-four elders. &ldquo;That these are saints, representatives
of all saints, seems perfectly evident.&rdquo; And
so there were saints in heaven, around the throne of
God, while another angle of the theory has them in the
air that surrounds the earth. Then John saw in the
right hand of God as he sat on the throne a book, close-sealed
with seven seals. None other than the Lord
Jesus Christ was found that could open that book. He
came and took the book out of the hand of him who
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
sat on the throne. So Jesus was up in heaven, in the
presence of the throne of God, at the very time one
angle of the theory has him in the air. And Brother
Boll believes he was there, for he says: &ldquo;When John
lifts up his eyes to see the mighty Lion, he discerns,
for the first time, in the midst of the central glory of
the Throne, the figure of &lsquo;a lamb standing.&rsquo;&rdquo; From
that time on we see Jesus taking an active part in all
that transpires around the throne in heaven. And
then we come to chapter 19. We here quote some comments
made by Brother Boll on that chapter: &ldquo;With
him are armies&mdash;the armies which are in heaven....
But who are these &lsquo;holy ones&rsquo; (that is, saints), and who
are these armies of heaven that follow in his train
&lsquo;upon white horses clothed in fine linen, white and
pure&rsquo;? The answer is indicated to us a few verses
above (1-9). In heaven, the saints previously taken
up, have joined their Lord in an eternal wedlock....
It is in this &lsquo;fine linen, white and pure,&rsquo; that we see
the armies of heaven arrayed, who follow him as he
comes forth. These armies are not angels; they are
his saints composing His Bride, &lsquo;the Lamb&rsquo;s wife.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Here, then, we have Jesus in heaven with his saints
ready to come forth from heaven, but another angle
of the theory has the Lord and his armies of saints
in the air ready to make the second stage of his
journey! Again: &ldquo;So from heaven, riding forth for
Israel&rsquo;s help, comes their Messiah at the head of the
heavenly host.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not refer to these matters to provoke any controversy,
but to show that we have not misrepresented
any one, and also to show that one angle of the future-kingdom
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
theory does not harmonize with another angle
of the theory. If a theory contradicts itself, we should
be excused if we contradict the theory. Both angles of
this theory cannot be true, and no man can put these
angles together in such a way as to make the theory
look good to one who knows that God&rsquo;s truth is in perfect
harmony with itself.</p>
<p>But the theory has the marriage of Christ to his
bride yet future. According to the theory, the church
is only <i>engaged</i> to Christ now. If that be so, in what
sense is he now Lord of his bride?</p>

<h2 id="c33"><span class="small">HOPE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S COMING</span></h2>
<p>Inspired men did teach that the Lord is coming
again; but when men affirm that the Holy Spirit
taught the early Christians to expect the Lord to come
the second time in their day, they virtually accuse the
Holy Spirit of raising hopes that they knew would not
be realized. We would expect infidels to argue that
inspired men taught things that turned out not to be
true. But the idea is so abhorrent to any one who believes
in the infallibility of the Holy Spirit and the absolute
truthfulness of everything he taught that it
seems that no one could for a moment regard it as a
harmless guess or as a matter about which we need
not be concerned. However, if the apostles did teach
such doctrine, we will have to acknowledge that they
did, even though it leads us to discredit the certainty
of their teaching. But did they teach it? Is there
any justice, reason, or foundation for putting them
under such a cloud of suspicion? Emphatically, no!</p>
<p>An argument to support the theory is built on a
misunderstanding of the word &ldquo;hope.&rdquo; We are told
that the apostles taught the early Christians to hope
for the Lord&rsquo;s coming, and that hope is made up of
desire and expectation, all of which is true. But they
assume that to hope for a thing is to expect it immediately,
or at any moment. Their own contention on
the word &ldquo;hope&rdquo; robs them of any hope of a millenial
kingdom; for they all contend that the Jews must return
to Palestine, Rome be developed again into a
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
great empire, and then some years of great tribulation
must pass before the millenial kingdom is set up.
With their idea of hope, they can hope for nothing except
that which may occur at any moment. But they
are wrong in their contention on hope. We plant a
crop, hoping for a good harvest; but no one is simple
enough to think the harvest may come at any moment.
The man who gives a large sum of money to build a
college or hospital hopes to benefit generations unborn.
We may lend, hoping to receive. Certainly no one
makes a loan expecting the return at any moment.
They are, therefore, wrong in assuming that imminency
inheres in expectancy. And they are wrong also as
to the basis of expectation. Expectation must have
more than conjecture, more than mere probability, for
a basis. I earnestly desire the Lord to come while I
live, but I do not expect him to do so, for I have
nothing on which to base such an expectation. But you
ask, &ldquo;Do you not think that the Lord might come while
you live?&rdquo; Certainly, but expectation must be based
on something more substantial than what may or may
not be. If the Lord should plainly tell me that he would
come while I live, I would have grounds for expecting
him to come before I die. But the Lord has never
told any generation that he would come during
the life of that generation, and for that reason no
one has ever expected the Lord to come while he
lived. If the apostles had taught the early Christians
that the Lord would come in their day, then
they could have expected him to come. But if the
apostles had so taught, they would have taught falsely,
for the Lord did not come then. But they did not
so teach, and therefore the early Christians did not
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
expect his return in their day. And yet they did, as
do all Christians today, expect him to come at some
period, for he said he would. They may have desired
that he come in their day, and we may desire him to
come in our day; but they had no grounds upon which
to expect him to come then, neither have we any
grounds for expecting him to come in our day.</p>
<p>The coming of the Lord is to be earnestly desired,
and yet the thought of his coming fills one with dread
and awe. Yet we are told that such feelings indicate
that there is something wrong with us, just as there is
something wrong with a wife if she feels uneasy at the
home-coming of a good husband. We are reminded
that the faithful wife gladly meets the devoted husband
when he returns from a journey, and that
children joyfully run to meet their father when he
comes home, and this should be our attitude and feeling
when the Lord comes. If we tremble at his
presence, there is something wrong! Is it possible
that any one so thinks? Does any one really think
that we can meet the Lord on the same basis that one
human being meets another? To teach that we should
have such feeling of familiarity as a wife has toward
her husband or as children have toward their father
is hurtful to piety and reverence. If the author of
the foregoing illustrations does not mean all this, his
illustrations do not mean anything. For years I have
had an earnest desire that the Lord come while I live,
and yet I know that when I appear before him in his
majesty and glory, I shall, like the beloved John, fall
at his feet as one dead. (Rev. 1:17.) I cannot think
that any Christian will feel otherwise. When Jehovah
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
spoke to Moses out of the burning bush, &ldquo;Moses trembled,
and durst not behold.&rdquo; (Acts 7:32.) Was there
something wrong with Moses and the beloved John?
But the author who presented the aforementioned
illustrations is wrong, as he himself will learn when
he appears in the presence of the Judge of all the
earth.</p>

obedience is a thing that must be learned. &ldquo;Though he

suffered.&rdquo; The service of God in this life is the school in
which we learn obedience; we must learn to serve here, or

<h2 id="c34"><span class="small">PAUL TO THE THESSALONIANS ON THE LORD&rsquo;S RETURN</span></h2>
<p>These Thessalonians had &ldquo;turned unto God from
idols, to serve a living God, and to wait for his Son
from heaven.&rdquo; To wait for the coming of the Lord does
not mean that we are to remain in idleness till he
comes. To wait on the Lord in any matter is to remain
steadfast in the hope that he will fulfill that
which he promised. It is a forward-looking attitude
of mind and heart, with confidence that God will fulfill
his word, whether soon or late.</p>
<p>In reading the Bible, we frequently allow the chapter
divisions to influence our conclusions. We forget
for the time that writers of the Bible made no division
into chapters and verses. In our study we should absolutely
disregard the chapter divisions, for the discussion
of a point begun in one chapter frequently
runs into the next. In the first Thessalonian letter
Paul&rsquo;s discussion of the events connected with the
Lord&rsquo;s return begins with the thirteenth verse of the
fourth chapter and ends with the eleventh verse of the
fifth chapter. If we ignore this fact, we deal unfairly
with Paul.</p>
<p>When Paul planted the church at Thessalonica, he
did not have time to fully instruct the new converts,
for he was soon driven away by fierce persecution.
Before he wrote his first letter to them, some of their
number had died. They did not know what would become
of these at the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Concerning them,
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
they had no hope; for they had no information upon
which to base any hope. Paul&rsquo;s purpose in writing the
section under consideration was to teach them that
they would &ldquo;sorrow not, even as the rest, who have no
hope.&rdquo; Through or by Jesus, God would bring these
dead saints to heaven; for the dead saints would be
raised from the dead, and, together with the living
saints, would be caught up in the clouds to meet the
Lord in the air. &ldquo;Wherefore comfort ye one another
with these words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Paul says that it is not necessary to say anything
to them about the times and seasons. &ldquo;The times
and the seasons&rdquo; of what? Of that concerning which
he had just told them about&mdash;namely, the coming of
the Lord and the resurrection of the dead saints, and
the ascension of all saints to meet him in the air. But
that day would come as a thief in the night; then what?
&ldquo;When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden
destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman
with child; and they shall in no wise escape.&rdquo; So,
then, in that day in which the Lord comes to gather to
himself his saints, sudden destruction will come upon
the rest of mankind. &ldquo;But ye, brethren, are not in
darkness, that that day should overtake you as a
thief.&rdquo; What day? The day of which he was speaking,
the day in which the saints shall be taken up and
the wicked shall suddenly be destroyed. Some would
have us believe that the saints will be secure in the day
when sudden destruction is visited upon the wicked,
because they shall have already been taken up to meet
the Lord in the air some years before that day of
destruction of the ungodly. But Paul tells us that that
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
day of destruction will not come upon them as a thief,
for they are all sons of light&mdash;they are ready and
watching. To fit the theory, Paul should have said
that that day would not overtake them, because they
would not be there, having already been caught up to
meet the Lord in the air.</p>
<p>Some people look at this Scripture so carelessly that
they actually think that Paul says the dead saints will
be raised before the wicked are raised. One good
brother, a friend of mine, quoted Scripture, to me as
follows: &ldquo;The dead in Christ shall rise first, and the
rest of the dead lived not again till the thousand years
are passed.&rdquo; But Paul was not contrasting the resurrection
of the saints and the wicked, but was speaking
of the dead saints and those living when Christ comes.
Will the living saints leave the dead in their graves?
No, the dead saints will be raised first&mdash;that is, before
the living ascend; and then all shall be caught up
to meet the Lord. Whether the wicked were to be
raised then, or were never to be raised, was not so
much as hinted at. But the passage does teach this:
When the Lord comes, the saints will be caught up
to meet him in the air, and the wicked will be destroyed
in that day. And that agrees with what Paul says in
his second letter to the Thessalonians.</p>
<p>In Paul&rsquo;s second letter to the Thessalonians he gives
some additional information concerning the coming of
the Lord and our gathering together unto him. From
the first verse of the second chapter we learn that the
coming of the Lord referred to is that coming in which
the saints are gathered together unto him. Paul would
not have them troubled by thinking that that day was
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
&ldquo;just at hand.&rdquo; One writer, well known to the Gospel
Advocate readers, makes this comment on the phrase,
&ldquo;at hand&rdquo;: &ldquo;In every translation known to me, except
the Douay, the King James, and the American Revised
Version, this reads &lsquo;the day of the Lord is now present.&rsquo;
Some one had made those Thessalonians believe
that the day of the Lord had already broken in
upon them.&rdquo; I know that some translations have
&ldquo;present&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;at hand&rdquo;, but they are not so
numerous as the foregoing quotation would have us
believe. The following translations have &ldquo;at hand&rdquo;:
Latin Vulgate, Bible Union, Living Oracles, Sharpe,
George R. Noyes (Harvard University teacher), Anderson,
Syriac, Sawyer, and James MacKnight. So
far as scholarship goes, it is very likely that the scholarship
back of the American Standard Version outweighs
the scholarship of all the translations referred
to in the foregoing quotation, with the exception of
the English Revision.</p>
<p>But it matters little to us what those Thessalonian
brethren thought about the matter; it does not
affect Paul&rsquo;s teaching on the subject. Paul tells us
that a falling away must come first and the man
of sin be revealed. This must be, he tells us, before the
coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering
together unto him. But the theory that is now so attractive
to some people has this man of sin developed
after the saints are taken up to meet the Lord in the
air; the man of sin is then to be destroyed at what is
termed the second stage of his coming. But Paul plainly
says that the coming he is here talking about is the
coming in which the saints are gathered together unto
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
the Lord. It is strange that a theory will so blind
people that they cannot see a plain statement in the
very passages from which they claim to deduce their
teaching.</p>

<h2 id="c35"><span class="small">RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD</span></h2>
<p>The following question came to me recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brother Whiteside: Do you not think that the expression,
&ldquo;resurrection from the dead,&rdquo; has reference to the
death state, rather than the meaning that some will come
&ldquo;out from among&rdquo; the other dead ones? Say something to
us in the Gospel Advocate along this line. John S. Clark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the growth of language it is common for words
to take on additional meanings. This, of course, is
common knowledge and needs no proof.</p>
<p>In the phrase, &ldquo;from the dead&rdquo; (ek nekron), the
word &ldquo;dead&rdquo; is plural in the Greek, but by a sort of
figure of speech, or extension of the meaning of the
word, it applies to the state of death; at least, some
passages of Scripture set forth that idea. In Rom. 6:13
we have the phrase, &ldquo;alive from the dead,&rdquo; and in I
John 3:14 we have the phrase, &ldquo;passed out of death
into life.&rdquo; In both passages the meaning is the same;
yet in Romans the Greek word from which we have
&ldquo;dead&rdquo; is plural, and in John we have another word
in the singular. The Romans had been dead in sins,
but were made alive from that death. The Cambridge
Greek Testament has this note: &ldquo;Ek nekron, as men
that are alive after being dead.&rdquo; Bloomfield: &ldquo;Ex nekron
zontas, as those who, after having been (spiritually)
dead, are now alive.&rdquo; Thayer: &ldquo;Zeen ek nekron,
tropically, out of moral death to enter upon a new life,
dedicated and acceptable to God (Rom. 6:13.)&rdquo; In
defining &ldquo;ek,&rdquo; Thayer has this: &ldquo;5. Of the condition
or state out of which one comes or is brought: ...
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
zontes ek nekron, alive from being dead&mdash;i. e., who
had been dead and were alive again (Rom. 6:13.)&rdquo; It
is plain, therefore, that the word &ldquo;dead&rdquo; in Rom. 6:13
refers to the death state. It is true that it refers here
to spiritual death, but its use in describing the state
of the sinner is a figurative use of the same expression
that is applied to the state of those who are dead
physically.</p>
<p>We have the same phrase in Rom. 11:15&mdash;&ldquo;life from
the dead&rdquo; (ek nekron). On this passage Thayer has
this: &ldquo;Zoa ek nekron, life breaking forth from the
abode of the dead.&rdquo; Bloomfield gives the following as
the sense of the whole verse: &ldquo;If their <i>sin</i>, which occasioned
this casting away, has been the means of reconciling
the world, by bringing about the death of
Christ, what shall the <i>receiving of them again into
the divine favor be</i> (whenever it shall take place),
but so happy a change, both to themselves and to the
Gentiles, as may, in a manner, be said to raise the
whole world from death to life? Zoe ek nekron, by a
figure common to all languages, denotes (as Turretin
and Stuart explain) something great and surprising,
like what a general resurrection from the dead would
be.&rdquo; So, according to Bloomfield, &ldquo;life from the dead&rdquo;
is life from death.</p>
<p>But it is contended by all the future-kingdom folks
that the phrase, &ldquo;resurrection from the dead&rdquo; (ek
nekron), applies to the righteous and never to the
wicked. Their cause depends upon their repudiating
the idea that the word &ldquo;dead&rdquo; refers to the death
state. They tell us that the righteous are raised before
the wicked, and are, therefore, raised &ldquo;out from
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
among&rdquo; dead ones. But their contention is not conclusive,
even if &ldquo;ek nekron&rdquo; should be rendered &ldquo;out
of the dead ones.&rdquo; In the first place, to make &ldquo;ek&rdquo;
mean <i>out from among</i> is stretching that little word
too much. Again, before the resurrection, the dead
ones are made up of both the righteous and the wicked.
Their contention will not allow that the righteous come
&ldquo;out from among&rdquo; the righteous dead. They do not,
then, come &ldquo;out from among&rdquo; the dead, but &ldquo;out from
among&rdquo; only a part of the dead. But &ldquo;out from among&rdquo;
is not even good English.</p>
<p>Again, granting, for argument&rsquo;s sake, that &ldquo;from
the dead&rdquo; means &ldquo;out of dead ones,&rdquo; their contention
then does not hold good. We view the field of the
dead; they are all there&mdash;the righteous, the sinners,
the infants, and all irresponsible people. They all
arise at once; have they not come out of the dead?
They were dead ones, now they are live ones; out of
the dead ones came the living ones. The apostles
preached a resurrection of both the just and the unjust.
(Acts 24:15). In Acts 4:2 &ldquo;ek nekron&rdquo; is used
in connection with the resurrection of all the dead.
The Sadducees were sorely troubled because the apostles
&ldquo;proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have never seen any provision, or place, for the
resurrection of infants and irresponsibles in the future-kingdom
theory, nor have I seen any place for
such in their future-kingdom. They cannot be rulers,
for they have not been tested and proved worthy of
such place; the most of them cannot be citizens, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
they are not Jews. Will they be raised before the millennial
kingdom begins? If so, what will be their status
in that kingdom, or will they be any part of it?</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">Contrary to all human tendencies, God would have us
celebrate the death of Christ instead of his birth. Had he
wanted us to celebrate his birth, he would not have left
its date in obscurity. A little attention to the history or
manner of shepherding in Palestine will convince anyone
that December 25 is not the correct date. In the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper, we celebrate his death; in observing the Supper
on the Lord&rsquo;s day, we celebrate his resurrection. We
honor Jesus by following in his steps and by doing his
will; we dishonor him and disgrace his cause by celebrating
his birth in the way it is usually done.</p>
<p class="bq">Abraham did not want Isaac to marry any daughter

<h2 id="c36"><span class="small">THEORY OF TWO RESURRECTIONS CONSIDERED</span></h2>
<p>In a former article it was shown that the word
&ldquo;dead&rdquo; in the phrase, &ldquo;resurrection from the dead,&rdquo;
sometimes, at least, refers to the death state. People
are raised from the dead&mdash;that is, the death state.
But it is contended by the future-kingdom folks that
there will be two resurrections&mdash;the righteous to be
raised from among the dead, and the rest of the dead
will be raised later. They insist that the phrase, &ldquo;from
the dead,&rdquo; shows that some of the dead will be left.
But their arguments have never seemed conclusive to
me.</p>
<p>It would be hard to get two resurrections more than
a thousand years apart out of the following language
of the Savior: &ldquo;Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh,
in which all that are in their tombs shall hear his
voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good,
unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done
evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.&rdquo; (John 5:28,
29.) There is to be an hour, or period, in which all, both
good and bad shall come forth from the dead at the call
of Jesus. The same thought&mdash;that is, that both will
be raised at the same time&mdash;is presented in Acts 4:1,
2: &ldquo;And as they spake unto the people, the priests
and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came
upon them, being sore troubled because they taught
the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection
from the dead.&rdquo; Here we have the phrase, &ldquo;resurrection
from the dead&rdquo; (ek nekron). The priests and the
captain of the temple were Sadducees. The Sadducees
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
did not believe in the resurrection of anybody. With
them death ended all. Are we to believe that they
stirred up all this trouble because the apostles taught
that the righteous would be raised before the wicked?
That point did not concern them, but to preach that
the dead would be raised did disturb them. The apostles
preached in Jesus a universal resurrection from
the dead. &ldquo;For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ
shall all be made alive.&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:22.) Before Felix,
Paul preached that he had hope toward God that there
would be a resurrection both of the just and the unjust.
(Acts 24:15.) It was that sort of preaching that
so exasperated the Sadducees. Hence, when the apostles
at Jerusalem preached that all would be raised
from the dead (ek nekron), it infuriated the Sadducees.
But the Pharisees believed in a universal resurrection.
Paul took advantage of this difference between
the Sadducees and Pharisees, when he was
brought before the council in Jerusalem, and said:
&ldquo;Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: touching
the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called
in question.&rdquo; (Acts 23:6.)</p>
<p>The two-resurrectionists seek to make a point on
Paul&rsquo;s effort to &ldquo;attain unto the resurrection from the
dead.&rdquo; (Phil. 3:11.) After quoting Phil. 3:10-14,
Charles M. Neal says: &ldquo;To present and emphasize
this thought, Paul invents a new word. This word,
&lsquo;exanastasis,&rsquo; occurs but this one time in the New
Testament. The phrase &lsquo;resurrection from the dead,&rsquo;
is translated by Rotherham as &lsquo;out-resurrection from
among the dead,&rsquo; and in the Emphatic Diaglott as
&lsquo;resurrection from among the dead&rsquo;.&rdquo; It is true that
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
the word occurs in the New Testament only in this
one place. But we become somewhat doubtful of one
who quotes as authority the Emphatic Diaglott, a
translation that is printed and sold by the Russellites.
And surely no one would seriously put Rotherham up
against the great body of scholars who gave the
American Standard Version.</p>
<p>But to seek to make &ldquo;exanastasis&rdquo; mean <i>out-resurrection
from</i> is to venture beyond the lexicons. Liddell
and Scott gives the New Testament meaning as
the <i>resurrection</i>. Thayer: <i>a rising up; a rising again;
resurrection</i>. Thus it is seen that Thayer, though himself
a premillennialist, gives no support to the idea in
defining the word. When a man gives a definition of
a word that is not sustained by either of these lexicons,
nor by the greatest body of scholars that was
ever gathered for any purpose, he puts entirely too
much stress upon himself.</p>
<p>It is true that &ldquo;ek&rdquo; or &ldquo;ex&rdquo; when standing alone as
a preposition, usually has the general meaning of &ldquo;out
of&rdquo;; but when used as a part of a compound word, as
in &rsquo;exanastasis&rsquo;, it sometimes merely intensifies the
meaning of the word to which it is joined, giving the
idea of &ldquo;utterly, entirely.&rdquo; See Thayer and Liddell
and Scott. If one has the time and opportunity, he may
also examine Winer (page 429) and Robertson&rsquo;s
Grammar of the Greek New Testament (pages 562-4,
596). If &ldquo;ex&rdquo; adds any meaning to the word here, it
merely means that Paul was striving to obtain a complete
resurrection, a perfect resurrection&mdash;that is, a
resurrection to life that is life indeed. In that respect
there is a decided difference between the resurrection
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
of a faithful Christian and a sinner, for a sinner
is not raised to real life.</p>
<p>Sometimes the preposition adds nothing to the
meaning of the word with which it is compounded&mdash;that
is, so far as we can see. Take, for illustration, the
verb from which we have &ldquo;exanastasis.&rdquo; It occurs in
Mark 12:19 and Luke 20:28&mdash;&ldquo;raised up seed unto his
brother.&rdquo; Here we have &ldquo;ex&rdquo; joined to the verb; but
in the parallel passage in Matt. 22:24, where the
meaning is bound to be exactly the same, the preposition
&ldquo;ex&rdquo; is left off. If adding &ldquo;ex&rdquo; to the verb does
not change this verb, how can one dogmatically argue
that it changes the noun that is derived from the verb?
The argument built on &ldquo;exanastasis&rdquo; is about as flimsy
an argument as one could find. A cause that depends
on such arguments cannot have a substantial basis.
But a wild theory is often supported by very tame arguments.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">One preacher can do very little toward establishing a
church in a great city. It is perhaps harder now than
ever. We have seen it tried. It would be better to take
Antioch as an example. Notice the number of workers that
concentrated their efforts on that city. They got results.
Paul generally had a group of helpers with him. Together
they did work in cities where one man would have failed,
or practically so. Ignoring this divine example and putting
one man in a city without real help, we have wasted
much effort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h2 id="c37"><span class="small">CHURCH AGES</span></h2>
<p>When a man tries to sustain a false theory in religion
he cannot do so by correct application of the
scriptures. He will make false arguments and pervert
the scriptures. A striking example of this is seen in
the efforts of some to find prophetic symbolisms in the
letters to the seven churches in Asia. These letters
were written to seven churches in seven cities of Asia
Minor, and they are recorded in the second and third
chapters of Revelation. Here is what Scofield says
in his Bible: &ldquo;The messages to the seven churches have
a fourfold application: (1) Local, to the churches actually
addressed; (2) admonitory, to all churches in
all time as tests by which they may discern their true
spiritual state in the sight of God; (3) personal, in
exhortations to him &lsquo;that hath an ear,&rsquo; and in the
promises &lsquo;to him that overcometh&rsquo;; (4) prophetic as
disclosing seven phases of the spiritual history of the
church from, say, A. D. 96 to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, when these men talk about the church
they include all that they call branches of the church.
They claim that we are now living in the period symbolized
by the church at Laodicea. There is not even
a hint that there were any prophetic symbolisms in the
condition of these churches. Of course they do not
claim that the condition of the church at Ephesus was
prophetic of a future period&mdash;its condition merely portrayed
the condition of the churches then. That is
absurd, for the six other churches mentioned were not
like Ephesus&mdash;in fact, there is not a hint that the Ephesus
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
church was like any other church of that day, and
yet the theory requires that the condition of the church
at Ephesus correctly represented all the churches of
that period. And then the other six churches are said to
represent, or symbolize, or forecast the condition of
the church at certain periods. The marking off the
period that each church is supposed to represent is
purely arbitrary. No one can prove, even if the theory
were true, that we live in the Laodicean period. But
the whole theory is fantastic, absurd, and a reflection
on God.</p>
<p>Think what the theory involves. How could a church
then determine the character of the whole church during
a certain period hundreds of years later? Or did
God by direct miraculous power make these churches
to be like what he knew the whole church would be at
different periods? Or did he by direct power make
the periods to be like the churches of Asia? In either
case people had to be what God by direct power chose
to make them. Where then is there room for freedom
of will, or freedom of action? Any one who can believe
that each of these churches was a forecast of the
whole church at a certain period can believe any foolish,
fantastic, absurd thing that the wildest imagination
can conceive. He does not have to have any evidence&mdash;he
just lets his imagination run riot. I would
like for some of its advocates to tell me when that
notion was hatched out, and by whom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<h2 id="c38"><span class="small">PHILADELPHIA AND THE HOUR OF TRIAL</span></h2>
<p>Foy E. Wallace, Jr., passes over to me a document
which was written in Detroit with a request that I say
something about it. The document would fill my page.
As much of it has no special bearing on the points
sought to be made, I will make liberal and fair quotations
from it. The passage commented upon first
is Rev. 3:10: &ldquo;Because thou didst keep the word of my
patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of trial,
that hour which is to come upon the whole world, to
try them that dwell upon the earth.&rdquo; I quote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The promise. &lsquo;The hour of trial&rsquo; was ahead, but
Philadelphia was to be kept from it. Not saved
through it, but kept from it....</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Hour. (1) It is the &lsquo;hour of trial&rsquo; with
emphasis on &lsquo;the&rsquo;. (2) It is the &lsquo;hour of trial&rsquo; with
emphasis on &lsquo;trial&rsquo;, for it is &lsquo;to try them that dwell
upon the earth.&rsquo; (4) It is yet future; &lsquo;to come upon
the whole world.&rsquo; Nothing has since occurred in history
filling out this picture.... (5) the Philadelphia
type of saints will escape.... Those who keep his
word are of the Philadelphia type of saints. The
church that is true to the word is a church of the
Philadelphian type and can lay claim to this same
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John wrote seven letters, dictated by the Lord, to
seven churches in Asia; the church at Philadelphia was
one of these churches. The Lord made a definite
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
promise to the church at Philadelphia. Naturally the
members of that church would understand that the
promise was to them; but that church long ago ceased
to exist. And yet we are told that the promise made to
those brethren is yet future. If that be so, then that
promise was not for those brethren at all! They
are all dead; was that the way the Lord was going to
keep them from the hour of trial? No, no; according
to the foregoing quotation, the promise was not meant
for the church at Philadelphia at all, but for the
churches of the Philadelphian type! Such juggling
with the record is both taking away from and adding
to the words of the book. The promise was not made
to the &ldquo;Philadelphian type of saints&rdquo;, but to the church
at Philadelphia. It is true that some promises, general
in their nature, though not to one individual or group
of individuals, are to be enjoyed by all who fulfill the
conditions; but certainly the ones to whom the promise
is directly made are included in the promise! But,
strange to say, according to the foregoing quotation,
the church at Philadelphia to whom the promise was
made was not included in the promise made directly
to them! That promise is yet future, so we are told.</p>
<p>But the implication of the quotation is that the
promise was made to the Philadelphian type of
churches, and that it is to be fulfilled in &ldquo;the rapture.&rdquo;
And what is it that a person cannot prove, if he is
allowed to juggle words to suit his theory? If the
hour of trial is yet future, the Lord kept Philadelphia
from it by deferring it till all those saints died. But
he conjures up a peculiar method of escape for those
saints who long ago died: (7) &ldquo;The method of escape
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
is found in such passages as 1 Thess. 4:16, 17. It is
often called the rapture, and properly so, from the
expression &lsquo;caught up,&rsquo; which rapture means.&rdquo; But
would not the saints of Philadelphia escape that supposed
three and a half years of tribulation if they
should remain in their graves?</p>
<p>I quote again: &ldquo;Other Designations. Jesus used the
term &lsquo;that day,&rsquo; also the term &lsquo;tribulation.&rsquo; Daniel
calls it &lsquo;a time of trouble&rsquo; such as is unequaled and
never repeated. In Jer. 30:7 it is &lsquo;the time of Jacob&rsquo;s
trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.&rsquo; Here is a
parallel to the escape of the three Hebrews from the
fiery furnace. Those who are &lsquo;saved out of it&rsquo; are
distinct from those who are kept from it. John has a
vision of a number who &lsquo;come out of the great tribulation,&rsquo;
but the Philadelphians are kept from it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He affirms that the various terms he names applies
to one certain period that is yet to be; but he gives not
one word of proof. The terms, &ldquo;that day,&rdquo; &ldquo;in that
day,&rdquo; &ldquo;day of trouble,&rdquo; &ldquo;tribulation,&rdquo; &ldquo;tribulations,&rdquo;
&ldquo;that hour,&rdquo; are used many times in the Bible, and
certainly do not all refer to the same period of time.
Why then pick out a term here and there and arbitrarily
apply them to one certain time? THE
REASON: a certain theory demands it. And if the
writer will examine the Greek in Jer. 30:7 and Rev.
3:10, he will find apo, from, in Jeremiah, and ek, out
of, in Revelation, which completely reverses the point
he seeks to make on the use of prepositions.</p>
<p>Again I quote: &ldquo;Chronology.... The order of
some outstanding things foretold is revealed. To get
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
this order saves confusion. From Jesus&rsquo; prophecy
on the mount (Matt. 24 and 25; Mark 13; Luke 21)
avoiding all forced interpretations, we learn &lsquo;the tribulation
of those days&rsquo; leads up to the darkening of the
sun and moon, the falling of the stars of the heaven,
the powers of the heaven being shaken, and the glorious
appearing of the Son of man. Note the expression
&lsquo;immediately after&rsquo; in Matt. 24:29. Note
also Mark 13:24-27 ... even up to the tribulation
there are foretold &lsquo;wars and rumors of wars,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom.&rsquo; Again, attention is called to the fact that
those days of unprecedented tribulation &lsquo;shall be
shortened.&rsquo; Obviously they are terminated by the
Son of man in connection with his appearing. The
times foretold in this connection constitute &lsquo;the days
of the Son of man.&rsquo; (see Luke 17:26.) The &lsquo;rapture&rsquo;
precedes &lsquo;the tribulation of those days,&rsquo; &lsquo;the days of the
Son of man.&rsquo; And the rapture awaits nothing that is
foretold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are difficulties in the discourse Jesus delivered
to the disciples on Olivet; but it is certain that
no one will get a correct idea of what was said if he
ignores the questions that gave rise to the speech.
Jesus was answering questions put to him by the disciples.
The disciples had called his attention to the
temple and its adornments. Jesus said: &ldquo;As for these
things which ye behold, the days will come, in which
there shall not be left here one stone upon another,
that shall not be thrown down.&rdquo; When they had
crossed to the mount of Olives, Peter, James, John,
and Andrew said to him: &ldquo;Teacher, when therefore
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when
these things are about to come to pass?&rdquo; Put yourself
in the place of these disciples: would you not understand
that everything Jesus said was in answer to
those two questions? Would Jesus confuse them by
saying a lot of things which they would understand to
be in answer to their questions, but were not? In
Mark&rsquo;s record we have: &ldquo;Tell us, when shall these
things be? and what shall be the sign when these
things are about to be accomplished?&rdquo; To say that
most of the answer Jesus gave related to something
about which they had not inquired is to accuse Jesus
of not dealing fairly with them. In Matthew&rsquo;s record
we have: &ldquo;Tell us, when shall these things be? and
what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end
of the world?&rdquo; For the last clause the marginal reading
has, &ldquo;Or, <i>the consummation of the age</i>.&rdquo; To say
that Matthew&rsquo;s report of these questions does not mean
the same as the reports of Mark and Luke is to accuse
some one of making a false report of the questions.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>It is singular that so many commentators take it
for granted that the disciples were, in Matthew&rsquo;s report,
asking about the second coming of Christ; but
that could not be. Jesus had not taught them anything
about his second coming; besides, they had never believed
that he would be put to death! The Jews held
to the idea that when the Messiah came, he would
abide, forever, ruling as a great king in Jerusalem.
How then could the disciples have been asking
questions about the second coming of Christ, when
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
they did not believe he would go away? It is astonishing
that commentators have overlooked this plain fact.
The disciples referred to his coming in judgment on
Jerusalem. The tribulation was the suffering of the
Jews when the Romans destroyed their nation and
Jerusalem. The temple was utterly destroyed. The
Jewish nation ended; darkness and gloom settled down
over the people. The fulfillment of what Jesus had
said was a sign that he was what he claimed to be&mdash;that
the Son of man was also the Christ, the Son of
God. For the natural phenomena mentioned you get
some explanation by reading Isa. 13:1-10.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">The treatment Joseph received at home would tend to
make him arrogant and overbearing. To serve the purpose
God had in view, these traits had to be toned down. A period
of slavery, followed by a rather long stay in prison,
would reduce his pride and feeling of importance. In both
slavery and imprisonment he learned to work under men,
and at the same time he learned to manage men. He also
learned business principles. A petted son does not have
much opportunity to learn any of these useful things.
Joseph had to be torn away from his father in order to
learn to be useful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<h2 id="c39"><span class="small">NEBUCHADNEZZAR&rsquo;S DREAM</span></h2>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar had a wonderful dream, and required,
on penalty of death, that the wise men tell
him the dream and its interpretation. None but
Daniel could do so. To the king Daniel said: &ldquo;Thou,
O king, sawest, and, behold, a great image. This
image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was
excellent, stood before thee; and the aspect thereof
was terrible. As for this image, its head was of fine
gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its
thighs of brass, its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and
part of clay. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out
without hands, which smote the image upon its feet
that were of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces.
Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and
the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like
chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind
carried them away, so that no place was found for
them: and the stone that smote the image became a
great mountain, and filled the whole earth.&rdquo; (Dan.
2:31-35.)</p>
<p>Before we read the interpretation of this dream,
let us observe: (1) that Nebuchadnezzar saw the complete
image, as if all its parts existed at the same time;
(2) that the stone smote the image on the feet; (3)
that the whole image from feet to head was broken in
pieces and scattered as dust; (4) and that no place
was found for them&mdash;no place for such parts as composed
that image.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p><i>The Interpretation</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Thou art the head of gold.
And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to
thee; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall
bear rule over all the earth. And the fourth kingdom
shall be strong as iron, for as much as iron breaketh in
pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that crusheth
all these, shall it break in pieces and crush.... And
in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up
a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall
the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but
it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms,
and it shall stand forever. For as much as thou
sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without
hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the
brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God
hath made known to the king what shall come to pass
hereafter.&rdquo; (Verses 36-45.)</p>
<p>This dream and the interpretation have furnished
a starting point for many sermons by gospel preachers.
Till recently they all contended that the kingdom of
this prophecy was set up in Jerusalem on the first
Pentecost after the resurrection of Christ, and then
and there entered upon the work which Daniel said it
would accomplish. It is now argued by a few brethren
that when Jesus comes again the kingdom of this
prophecy will then have its real beginning, and will
then destroy the image of Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream.
But is there anything in the interpretation to warrant
such a radical change from a century of gospel preaching?</p>
<p>The four world kingdoms represented in the image&mdash;Babylon,
Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome&mdash;came and
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
fell in the order mentioned. Yet Nebuchadnezzar
saw them in the image, as if all existed at the same
time. The stone is represented as breaking in pieces
the whole image&mdash;that is, the kingdom of God is represented
as destroying all of the four world kingdoms.
&ldquo;It broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the
silver, and the gold.&rdquo; In truth, it was an image of
world empire, and that was broken in pieces, never
to be made whole again. Every attempt at world
empire, since Rome, has ended in failure, and will
continue to fail.</p>
<p>It is also plainly stated that in the days of these
kings&mdash;that is, while the image still remained&mdash;the
God of heaven would set up a kingdom, and that this
kingdom would destroy the image. The Roman Empire
embodied all that was in the other three kingdoms
of the image. So long as Rome existed the
image stood. The stone smote the image on the feet,
but destroyed every part of the image. Every kingdom
represented in that image has ceased to be; the
image has been entirely destroyed&mdash;not a vestige of
it remains. It follows, then, with the force of a demonstration,
that the kingdom of God has been set up.
Even though it be claimed that another world empire
is yet to be, it cannot, by any juggling of words or
flight of the imagination, be made a part of the image
of Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream. In that image each kingdom
merged into the one following it till Rome; then
the stone smote the image and destroyed it. As the
kingdom was to be set up during the existence of that
image, and as that image has been destroyed, it proves
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
beyond a doubt that the God of heaven has set up his
kingdom.</p>
<p>So far as the interpretation of the dream shows, the
kingdom of God was to destroy only the kingdoms of
the image; and it could destroy the first three only as
they were represented in the Roman Empire. World
Empires died with Rome. The principles of the kingdom
of Christ have so modified human thinking as to
destroy the possibility of world empire.</p>
<p>But we are told that Daniel&rsquo;s language shows that
these kingdoms are to be destroyed suddenly, and by
violent impact. But it cannot be shown that Daniel&rsquo;s
language requires such method of destruction. The
kingdom was to grind them to dust. Does that only
imply destruction? Besides, the future-kingdom idea
is that the kingdom of God will be ushered in in full
power; whereas the dream represents it as a stone
that destroyed the image and then grew into a
mountain that filled the earth. If you still insist that
Daniel&rsquo;s language shows that the kingdoms are to be
destroyed by violent impact, then I ask you to consider
carefully the language of Jer. 1:9, 10: &ldquo;Then Jehovah
put forth his hand, and touched my mouth; and Jehovah
said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in
thy mouth: see, I have this day set thee over the nations
and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break
down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to
plant.&rdquo; That is as strong language as Daniel uses in
describing the work of the kingdom of God; yet we
know that Jeremiah destroyed nothing by violent impact.
Yet how these future-kingdom advocates would
have stressed this language if it had been used to

describe the work of the kingdom instead of the work
of Jeremiah! It would be interesting to see them try
to show how Dan. 2:44, 45 requires violence, but Jer.
1:9, 10 means &ldquo;peaceful penetration.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">A thing gained through deceit or fraud cannot bring
contentment and satisfaction. Jacob never enjoyed any
real happiness in possessing the birthright, and the blessings
he obtained from Isaac by fraud made him an exile
and caused him much worry and distress. One cannot see
wherein it was any real satisfaction to him.</p>
<p class="bq">We get into trouble when we scheme and plan to help
God work out his plans. When God announced, even before
Esau and Jacob were born, his purposes concerning
these two prospective sons of Isaac and Rebekah, Rebekah
should have realized that God would work out his plans
in his own way; but she thought she must do some scheming
to help God work out his plans. In so doing she lost
the company of her beloved son and caused him untold misery.</p>

<h2 id="c40"><span class="small">MILLIGAN ON NEBUCHADNEZZAR&rsquo;S DREAM</span></h2>
<p>After I wrote my recent article on &ldquo;Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s
dream and its interpretation,&rdquo; I found a
series of articles on the kingdom, written by Robert
Milligan and published in the Millenial Harbinger of
1858. That the reader may see that the positions set
forth in my article are neither new nor fanciful, I
quote some extracts from Bro. Milligan&rsquo;s articles. Concerning
the establishment of the kingdom foretold in
Daniel&rsquo;s interpretation of the dream, Mr. Milligan
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prophet limits the chronology of the event to &ldquo;The
days of these kings.&rdquo; But who are they? When did they
reign? What was the beginning, the duration, the end of
their administration?</p>
<p>Many writers on prophecy, and even some of our own
brethren, for whose opinions we entertain very great respect,
refer all this to the future. They suppose by &ldquo;<i>these
kings</i>&rdquo; are meant the ten kingdoms into which the Roman
Empire was divided, and which they suppose were symbolized
by the ten toes of the image.... But with all due
respect for these good brethren, we are constrained to dissent
from such an interpretation of the passage. To us
there appear to lie against it many objections, some of
which are the following:</p>
<p>1. The notion that the toes of the image were designed
to represent the ten fragments of the Western Roman
Empire is a mere hypothesis. It may possibly be true;
but certain it is that the evidence is wanting.... But ten
toes on one foot would be rather incongruous.</p>
<p>2. But even if it could be satisfactorily shown that the
ten toes were designed to represent the fragments of the
ten kingdoms that arose out of the Western Empire, it
would by no means follow that these are identical with
the kings named in the text. The reverse of this is certainly
true. The limiting adjective, &ldquo;<i>these</i>,&rdquo; implies that
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
the subject to which it refers had been clearly designated....
But the only kings fairly implied in the whole connection
are those of the four universal monarchies....</p>
<p>From these premises we infer that the phrase, &ldquo;<i>these
kings</i>,&rdquo; has no reference to the monarchs of modern Europe.
Nor does it, as some have supposed, refer exclusively
to the Caesars. These are not in this connection made the
subject of a distinct prophecy. The phrase evidently refers
to all the rulers of the four universal monarchies, and
comprehends the kings of Babylon, and Persia, and Macedonia,
as well as those of Rome.</p>
<p>The meaning of this passage, then, is simply this: that
at some epoch during the lifetime of that human monster,
or between the time of Nebuchadnezzar and the fall of the
Roman Empire in the year of Christ 476, the God of heaven
would set up a kingdom in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After some discussion of the events of the first
Pentecost after the resurrection of Christ, Brother
Milligan says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According, then, to the testimony of Peter, Jesus Christ
was, on the day of Pentecost, seated on the throne of David,
not in Jerusalem, as the Jews anticipated, but in heaven
at the right hand of God. He was exalted to the rank and
dignity of a Prince as well as a Savior. And hence, for
the first time in the history of the world, those who gladly
received his word were commanded to be baptized in <i>the
name of Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his second article Brother Milligan quotes Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s
dream and Daniel&rsquo;s interpretation thereof,
and then comments as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The image was then smitten upon the feet. The wound
was mortal. The tyrant that had governed the world from
the days of Nebuchadnezzar till that hour was slain. His
spirit was subdued, and his whole physical organization,
consisting of gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and clay,
was then broken into fragments.</p>
<p>Since that time Charlemagne, Napoleon, and many others,
have attempted to revive the spirit and reunite the
scattered fragments of this fallen image. But all such attempts
have been in vain.... It is true, the spirit of war
still exists: blood is often shed for the most trivial causes.
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
But let any prince or potentate now attempt to revive the
spirit of this fallen image; let him attempt, like Nebuchadnezzar,
Cyrus, Alexander, and Caesar, to subdue the
world, and to govern it on the principle that &ldquo;might makes
right;&rdquo; and if not treated as a maniac by his own subjects,
he will, at least, find arrayed against him the combined
powers of Christendom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In view of what happened to the Kaiser when he
tried to conquer the world, the last statement of
Brother Milligan looks almost like prophecy. But it
was not a prophecy, but merely a statement based on
Daniel&rsquo;s interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<p>I invite the future-kingdom advocates to consider
the following:</p>
<p>1. The image, as it stood before Nebuchadnezzar,
represented four world empires. That is, of course,
admitted.</p>
<p>2. The kingdom of God was to be set up while that
image stood, and was to destroy the image. On that
point no one can mistake what Daniel says.</p>
<p>3. That image has been destroyed&mdash;there has not
been a world empire since the days of Rome.</p>
<p>4. It is certain, therefore, that the kingdom of God
has been established, and that the principles of that
kingdom have broken down and destroyed world empires.</p>
<p>It is a pity that a man will become so obsessed with
a speculative idea as to say that the image has been
destroyed, but the kingdom of God had nothing to do
with its destruction. To me it looks like a flat denial
of what Daniel says.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<h2 id="c41"><span class="small">A LEADING DOCTRINE OF THIS CURRENT REFORMATION</span></h2>
<p>When I was a young man, the gospel preachers who
were then active in preaching the ancient gospel
preached often on the establishment of the kingdom.
As I recall those sermons, they usually began with the
dream of Nebuchadnezzar and Daniel&rsquo;s interpretation
thereof, as recorded in the second chapter of Daniel.
It was argued that the kingdom foretold in verse 44
began on the first Pentecost after the resurrection of
Christ. That was one position on which there was no
disagreement among &ldquo;Christians only&rdquo; in those days.
It is true that there had been some speculations to the
contrary in the days of Alexander Campbell. One Dr.
John Thomas was a leading spirit in that agitation.
It was contended that the restoration of the Israelites
to a kingdom of their own in Palestine was the hope&mdash;the
Elpis&mdash;of Israel. While we do not recognize Mr.
Campbell as authority in matters of faith, we do recognize
him as a teacher of great ability. It will do us
good to read carefully some things Mr. Campbell wrote
on the kingdom question. Note how the following fits
into the present agitation on this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will receive it as a favor from any person, to be informed
of any people or preacher, on this continent or in
the European world, that clearly or definitely stated or
announced, in unequivocal affirmation, that the Christian
church did not commence, and, consequently, was never
organized, till the first Pentecost after the crucifixion,
death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and glorification of
the Lord Jesus Christ; that then placed upon the throne
of David, and upon the throne of God, he commenced his
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
reign <i>personally</i> in heaven and <i>spiritually</i> upon the earth,
by the mission of the Holy Spirit to his apostles, and
through them to his church, which is now his natural and
earthly body&mdash;the fullness, or manhood development, of
Him who fills all things, in all places, with life, and beauty,
and happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The foregoing is taken from the Millenial Harbinger
of February, 1852. In a footnote to the foregoing
quotation we have the following from Mr. Campbell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To prevent misconception of this allusion to the throne
of David, I simply remark for the present, to be developed,
probably more fully again, that the <i>throne of David</i> was,
in fact, the <i>earthly throne of God</i>, in the midst of ancient
Israel. David was his viceroy&mdash;that is, <i>the Lord&rsquo;s anointed</i>&mdash;a
fact not well understood by the church, and still less
by some untaught and unteachable dogmatists of the present
day. It was necessary to the plans of Jehovah, which
are all sublimely grand and wonderful, that he should have
two thrones&mdash;one on earth and one in heaven&mdash;for a time
occupied one above, by himself, and one below, by his vicegerent,
called or constituted by him; and therefore his
solemn oath or covenant with David, that he would raise
out of his person, in fullness of time, one that would occupy
both thrones. Hence, said the inspired bard of Israel,
&ldquo;Jehovah said to my Jehovah, Sit thou on my right hand
till I make thy foes thy footstool.&rdquo; It is beautifully in accordance
with this fact that Mary the Virgin was the last
bud on the tree of David which could blossom and fructify,
and bring forth a representative of David. So that, if
Jesus be not the heir of David&rsquo;s throne, there never can
be one born, and God&rsquo;s covenant has failed. This is a death
blow to Jewish infidelity, if their eyes were not closed and
their ears sealed. But Jesus was the Son of David, and
born to be a King, as he told Caesar&rsquo;s representative. On
the throne of David, as King of kings, he now sits, and also
on the throne of God; for he has all crowns upon his
head, and affirms that all authority in heaven and on
earth is given him.</p>
<p>Any one who desires to peruse the most conceited, consequential,
and dogmatical treaties, based upon hallucination,
and parody of the words &ldquo;Elpis Israel,&rdquo; will, if
he have a dollar to throw away, have a demonstration of
a disease called in Kentucky &ldquo;the <i>big head</i>,&rdquo; probably unequaled
in this century; making the <i>hope of Israel</i>&mdash;indeed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
the hope of the gospel in full development&mdash;to consist in
raising up again a throne of David in Palestine in Jerusalem;
as if that throne had been vacant now for eighteen
hundred years, or as if Jesus Christ would remove his
throne out of the heavenly Jerusalem, to rebuild and locate
it in old Jerusalem, and there to aggrandize the empire
of the universe! But this only in passing, as one of the
specimens of the power of the love of notoriety or of the
marvelous, in wrecking and bewildering the human mind.
We regard this development of the passion for notoriety
as one of the most admonitory dispensations in our immediate
circle of observation. It has made a man, that might
have been useful, worthless to himself, worthless to his
friends, and worse than worthless to the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the January Harbinger (1851) Mr. Campbell reports
a sermon which he preached at Bloomington,
Ind., from which I glean the following excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On Saturday night our subject was the promised advocacy
of the Spirit, after the return and coronation of the
Messiah in heaven; the commencement of his kingdom, and
the peculiarities of the Christian dispensation, in contrast
with the patriarchal and Jewish institutions. We gave reasons
why Christianity, or the kingdom of Christ, could not
be developed till he received all authority in heaven and
earth&mdash;till he received the kingdom and government of
the universe.&rdquo; &ldquo;The kingdom has come, and the king has
been on the throne of David now more than eighteen hundred
years: still, myriads are yet praying, &lsquo;Thy kingdom
come&rsquo;!&rdquo; &ldquo;Thus Jesus, after he had expiated our sins on
earth, entered heaven, and basing his intercession, <i>as our
high priest</i>, upon his sacrifice, he sat down a priest upon
his throne, &lsquo;after the order of Melchizedek;&rsquo; a high priest
forever, &lsquo;according to the power of an endless life.&rsquo; This,
as set forth, is a leading doctrine of this current reformation....
It is pregnant with great revolutionizing and
regenerating principles.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Jesus is not now our anointed Prophet, Priest,
and King, he is not yet the Christ. Do you believe Jesus
to be the Christ now, or the Christ that is yet to
be?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<h2 id="c42"><span class="small">IS THE CHURCH THE KINGDOM?</span></h2>
<p>Bro. Ira C. Moore, in F. F. of June 17, (190?) says
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He reasons that because these two words are
from Greek words of different meanings, and because
the two words themselves have no meaning in
common, therefore they can not apply to the same
thing. He says the meaning of a word may be substituted
by the word and make sense, and refers to our
use of this principle in reference to baptism and
sprinkling. The principle is true in the main, but
Bro. Moore&rsquo;s reasoning from it is as fallacious as can
be. No one claims that the words kingdom and church
mean the same. To describe or define a specific act
words must of necessity be synonymous, yet words
very different in meaning may be applied to the same
person or thing, owing to the different relations that
a person or thing sustains to the world. Man, husband,
father, citizen, author, and president are words
very different in their meanings, yet all of them apply
to one person Theodore Roosevelt. In the different
positions of life he occupies the relation that each of
these words indicates. Because all these words are
appropriately applied to him does that mean that you
can take a sentence in which one of them is used and
replace it with either of the words and make sense.
&ldquo;I, Theodore Roosevelt, husband, or author, or father
of the United States,&rdquo; etc. How is that? &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;
did you say? Just so.</p>
<p>Apostle, Author, Shepherd, Bishop, Bread of Life,
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
Bridegroom, Star, Captain, Christ, Corner Stone,
Counselor, Governor, Head of the Church, High
Priest, King, Master, Mediator, Prophet, Physician,
and a number of other names and designations apply
to one Being yet they differ in meaning. In different
relations different words apply to Him. Just so with
the church. It is called body, family, temple, house,
kingdom, etc. Viewing it from different standpoints,
you use different scripture words. Being &ldquo;called out,&rdquo;
it is the church, as an organization, it is the body of
Christ; as a government, having Christ as its King;
it is the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p>This is enough&mdash;you see the point.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">People spend much time and energy in worrying about
things that are entirely in the hands of God. We worry
about the weather, and we worry about how God will work
out his plans in the final windup of all earthly matters. If
we believe in God and in Christ, why worry?</p>
<p class="bq">Wherein God invites us to trust him, he will not betray
us. To doubt him is sin. He is not slack concerning
his promises. He rewards abundantly those who put their
trust in him&mdash;those who love him serve him.</p>
<p class="bq">If by faith we could see the Lord as he is and could

<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<h2 id="c43"><span class="small">THIS GOVERNMENT AND JEHOVAH&rsquo;S WITNESSES</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Brother Whiteside:</p>
<p>It seems to me that we ought not to oppose any move
upon the part of the government to respect the conscience
of sincere individuals. There are too many people in this
country who would like to see us stop preaching for us to
help further any movement which would deny the right to
preach to certain religious groups.</p>
<p>There have been efforts in some cities to make it illegal
for the &ldquo;Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses&rdquo; to distribute their literature
or to sell it on the streets. These, in so far as they have
come to my attention, have been declared unconstitutional.
For this I am thankful, for I know once such laws are
placed upon the books that they will be used by people
against us in certain sections of the country. I have met
people who would have invoked legal aid, if they had the
power to do so, to prevent us from preaching in certain
places by means of the tract. It seems to me that laws
which might be passed and used against &ldquo;Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses&rdquo;
could be easily used in the hands of vested interests
and tricky lawyers to rob the church of Christ of
the liberty of free speech.</p>
<p>Then, too, it would be easy for an intense patriot to label
the teachings of the New Testament, and thus of the
church of Christ, as subversive. They could point out that
the New Testament teaches that&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Christians are kings and priests. (Rev. 1:6.)</p>
<p>2. That we are endeavoring to establish a kingdom in
the United States which is world-wide in its mission and
which acknowledges as its supreme ruler Jesus Christ instead
of Washington.</p>
<p>3. That this kingdom has been antagonistic, to say the
least, to some governments of the past. (Dan. 2:44.)</p>
<p>4. That members of this kingdom believe that it was
prophesied by Isaiah, who said that, among other things,
its members would beat their swords into plowshares and
cease to learn the ways of war. (Isa. 2:2-4.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>5. That they are not allowed to take vengeance. (Rom.
12:19.) From this they could draw conclusions which would
lead many people to take steps to curtail our religious
freedom.</p>
<p>For these reasons, if for no other, it seems to me that
your article in the Gospel Advocate for March 26, 1942,
was unnecessary. It helps encourage a movement which
could easily result in opposition to the gospel.</p>
<p>Of course I do not accept the peculiar doctrines of the
&ldquo;Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses.&rdquo; I think we ought to teach them,
among other things, Paul&rsquo;s teaching concerning the proper
attitude to civil powers. (Rom. 13:1.)&mdash;James D. Bales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brother Bales surely has not thought this thing
through. As I see it, if &ldquo;Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses&rdquo; are to
be allowed unmolested to distribute their literature
of opposition to all human governments, neither should
a rabid German propagandist be molested in this
country.</p>
<p>I made no effort to &ldquo;oppose any move on the part of
the government to respect the conscience&rdquo; of any citizen
of this government. So far the government has
been as considerate as could be expected. But suppose
a citizen of Germany, one wholly loyal to his government,
were doing propaganda work on the streets of
our cities, he would certainly be conscientiously opposed
to doing military service for this government.
Would Brother Bales think this government should so
respect his conscience as to let him go on with his subversive
activities? He is an individual, and he has a
conscience, and he would certainly be sincere in his devotion
to his government. Brother Bales makes no exceptions
when he speaks of &ldquo;the conscience of sincere
individuals.&rdquo; Do you say he was speaking of citizens
of this government? If so, he leaves &ldquo;Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
out, they themselves being witnesses, as a
glance at their teaching will show.</p>
<p>Both Russell and Rutherford taught that &ldquo;the times
of the Gentiles,&rdquo; of which the Bible speaks, is the time
in which God permitted the Gentiles to rule in the
governments of the earth. Their language is too plain
to admit of any misunderstanding. Mr. Russell taught
that the saints should be submissive to Gentile governments
up to the close of the times of the Gentiles, or to
the limit of their right to rule. With these people the
times of the Gentiles began &ldquo;when the diadem was
taken from Zedekiah,&rdquo; and lasted till A. D. 1914. In the
1912 edition of <i>The Time Is at Hand</i>, Vol. 2, (&ldquo;copyright
1889&rdquo;), Mr. Russell says: &ldquo;In this chapter we
present the Bible evidence proving that the full end of
the times of the Gentiles&mdash;i. e., the full end of their
lease of dominion&mdash;will be reached in A. D. 1914; and
that date will be the fartherest limit of the rule of imperfect
men.&rdquo; (Pages 76, 77.) &ldquo;So, then, Gentile rule
had a beginning, will last for a <i>fixed time</i>, and will end
at the time appointed.&rdquo; (Page 78.) During the times
of the Gentiles the saints were to &ldquo;render to them due
respect and obedience,&rdquo; but &ldquo;to keep separate from
the kingdoms of this world as strangers, pilgrims, and
foreigners.&rdquo; That eliminates them from citizenship
in any government of the world, in so far as one can
eliminate himself. &ldquo;Foreigners&rdquo; are not citizens. And
their submission to Gentile governments was to end
when the times of the Gentiles ended, when this new
order would enter in full force. In the &ldquo;Finished
Mystery,&rdquo; published in 1917, we have this: &ldquo;Their
united testimony is that the times of the Gentiles have
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
expired, the reign of Christ has begun, all earthly potentates&mdash;civil,
social, ecclesiastical, and financial&mdash;must
give way to the new order of things, and will not
give way peaceably, but must be ejected.&rdquo; (Page 231.)
This volume was written and published after Russell&rsquo;s
death. After all the date setting for the end of Gentile
governments, we have this: &ldquo;There is evidence that
the establishments of the kingdom in Palestine will
probably be in 1925, ten years later than we once calculated.&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Finished Mystery,&rdquo; page 128.)</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Our Lord&rsquo;s return&rdquo; Rutherford says: &ldquo;The
word &lsquo;world&rsquo; means the social and political order or
rule governing the people.&rdquo; (Page 35.) &ldquo;The end of
the Gentile rule, therefore, would mark necessarily the
legal end of the present order; therefore, the end of the
world&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the end of the &ldquo;social and political
order or rule governing the people.&rdquo; (Page 37.)
&ldquo;This does not mean the end of trouble, but it does
mean, according to Jesus&rsquo; words, that the old world
legally ended in 1914.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Millions Now Living Will
Never Die,&rdquo; page 19.) Hence, according to Rutherford,
no government now has any right to exist; they
are all usurpers and in rebellion against the world&rsquo;s
rightful ruler. Who is the rightful ruler? In passages
too numerous to quote they tell us that Christ
would be the universal king when the times of the
Gentiles ended in 1914. But who is the Christ of
Rutherford? &ldquo;The Christ consists of Jesus glorified,
the head, and the members of his body, which constitute
the church.&rdquo; (Page 76.) Russell taught the
same. The church and Jesus constitute the Christ,
and they are now the rightful rulers of the world; no
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
other government has any right to exist. That is
their teaching. They, therefore, claim to owe no allegiance
to any human government, but are opposed to
all human governments. If any of our brethren who
are conscientious objectors hold to positions similar to
the foregoing, then they should have registered as
aliens, as should all followers of Rutherford.</p>
<p>At the risk of making this too long, I wish to notice
by number the items listed by Brother Bales.</p>
<p>1. Read the American Standard Version on Rev.
1:6, then look at the Greek. &ldquo;Kingdom,&rdquo; not &ldquo;kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. I am not endeavoring to establish a kingdom in
the United States.</p>
<p>3. I know not what Brother Bales means by &ldquo;antagonistic&rdquo;;
that is a strong word.</p>
<p>4. We have not space here to discuss this passage,
(Isa. 2:2-4) but trust to do so later.</p>
<p>5. No individual is allowed to take vengeance; even
this government forbids that. God takes vengeance
through his appointed channel, the human government.</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">Israel fell because of its own internal corruption, and
so has many another nation fallen. That is the greatest
danger facing our nation today. When God is ruled out of
the educational, social, and business life of a nation all sorts
of corruption follows, and corruption means decay and
death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<h2 id="c44"><span class="small">THE NEW TESTAMENT WORD FLESH</span></h2>
<p>In the New Testament the word <i>flesh</i> does not always
have the same significance. Sometimes it refers
to our material bodies, and sometimes to the bodies of
other living things. (1 Cor. 15:39.) It sometimes refers
to that state or condition in which the gratifying of
the appetites and passions of our bodies is our chief
concern&mdash;strictly a worldly life. (Romans 7:5, 8:6-9.)
It is to mind the flesh&mdash;a contrast with a spiritual
life. And some times the word <i>flesh</i> refers to a
race or nation, as distinguished from another race or
nation. Paul speaks of the Jews as &ldquo;my flesh&rdquo;.
(Rom. 11:14.) &ldquo;As concerning the flesh&rdquo;, Christ was
of the fathers of the Jewish race&mdash;that is, as to his
flesh he was a Jew. After stating that Christ died for
all, Paul adds, &ldquo;Wherefore we henceforth know no
man after the flesh: even though we have known
Christ after the flesh, yet now know him so no more.&rdquo;
In Christ there are no fleshly distinctions&mdash;no race
discriminations. &ldquo;For there is no distinction between
Jew and Greek: for the same Lord is Lord of All.&rdquo;
(Rom. 10:12.) And as Christ is the savior of both
Jew and Gentile, and is Lord of all&mdash;king over all, we
can no longer regard him as a Jew&mdash;we no longer
think of him as a Jew, or in any way identified with
fleshly Israel. Yet the future Kingdom advocates
still identify him with fleshly Israel and speak of him
as &ldquo;Israel&rsquo;s Christ,&rdquo; &ldquo;Israel&rsquo;s Messiah,&rdquo; &ldquo;Israel&rsquo;s
King.&rdquo; They encourage the Jew to glory in the fact
that he is a Jew. They would have the Jew to believe
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
that the Jewish nation is even yet God&rsquo;s chosen people,
a nation with glorious future, exalted above all others
subservient to them. But not so with Paul.</p>
<p>Some of the early professed Christians gloried in the
Jewish nation with all its traditions and every thing
Jewish, and tried to bind these on Gentile Christians.
Concerning their attitude and his own ideal Paul said,
&ldquo;For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves
keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised,
that they may glory in your flesh. But far
be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been
crucified unto me, and I unto the world. For neither
is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a
new creature. And as many as shall walk by this rule,
peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel
of God.&rdquo; (Gal. 6:13-16.) These Judaizers gloried in
the flesh, gloried in the fact that they were Jews: and
they were prototypes of those who now encourage the
Jews to glory in the fact that they are Jews; but Paul
gloried only in the cross of Christ, and pronounced
peace upon all who followed his rule. Disturbance and
strife followed those ancient Judaizing preachers, as
it does those today who glory in the modern version
of that nation. The Judaizers did so much harm in
the churches of Galatia where Paul had done so much
labor, that it so stirred Paul&rsquo;s feelings that he said,
&ldquo;I would that they that unsettle you would even go
beyond circumcision,&rdquo; or as the marginal reading has,
&ldquo;Greek, <i>mutilate themselves</i>.&rdquo; (Gal. 5:12.) Concerning
this same class of men, he said to the Philippians,
&ldquo;beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
beware of the concision,&rdquo; and then adds, &ldquo;for we
are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of
God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence
in the flesh.&rdquo; The context shows plainly that Paul
had no confidence in his Jewish flesh&mdash;no confidence
in the fact that he was a Jew, even though he had more
grounds for such confidence than did the Judaizing
disturbers. &ldquo;... if any other man thinketh to have
confidence in the flesh, I yet more.&rdquo; And then Paul
gives the grounds on which he might, if it were worth
anything, have more confidence in the flesh than his
Judaizing enemies: &ldquo;circumcised the eighth day, of
the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew
of Hebrews.&rdquo; In his fleshly relations he had all the
advantages that any Jew could have had. &ldquo;Howbeit
what things were gain to me, these have I counted
loss for Christ. Yet verily, I count all things to be
loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all
things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain
Christ, and be found in him.&rdquo; (Read Phil. 3:2-11.)
Paul gave up his fleshly connection and all that pertained
to it, as refuse, or dung, that he might gain
Christ; he could not gain Christ and justification by
faith in him without so doing. And yet all over this
country, in the press, in the pulpit and over the radio,
men are teaching that to the Jew belongs the glory of
that supposed kingdom. In that kingdom only the
Jews will be citizens; other people will be subservient
to them, and will have to come to the Jews for
favors! That really teaches the Jew to have confidence
in the flesh&mdash;to glory in the fact that he is a
Jew. It cannot develop in him a spirit of humility,
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
and therefore hinders his conversion. He must, as
Paul did, give all that up, or he can never gain Christ.</p>
<p>Recently I heard David L. Cooper, who, Dr. Weber
said, is the greatest living Bible scholar, answer some
questions in a radio speech. In giving answer to a
question as to the setting up of the kingdom, he said
that the spiritual kingdom which John announced as
at hand was set up on the first Pentecost after the
resurrection of Christ, but that when Christ returns
to earth he will set up his visible kingdom, and that
there would be no peace on the earth till that was done.
In answering another question he said that Christ will
not come till national Israel confess their national sin
of rejecting him. If this last statement is true, then
the coming of Christ is not imminent, but likely it is
far in the future, for there are no signs now that the
Jews will ever make such a confession. And if Cooper
is right the Jews have the peace of the world in their
keeping; for according to him the peace of the world
depends on Christ&rsquo;s second coming, and his coming depends
on the conversion of the Jews. So Christ&rsquo;s
second coming is not imminent, and the Jews hold the
destiny of the world in their hands! And I see no
chance for the Jews to act nationally in anything&mdash;how
can they?</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">Here is one lesson that Israel never did learn, nor
has the world yet learned it: &ldquo;O Jehovah, I know that the
way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that walketh
to direct his steps.&rdquo; (Jer. 10:23.)</p>

<h2 id="c45"><span class="small">FUTURE-KINGDOM DOCTRINES</span></h2>
<p>A brother in Tennessee wants to know the difference,
if any, between the church and the kingdom
of Christ. A brother in Florida writes an article
about long enough to fill my page, seeking to prove
that the prophets foretold a kingdom yet future. Occasionally
a brother over in Arkansas has written me
along the same lines. The scheme argued by these two
brethren is along the same lines argued by other future-kingdom
advocates.</p>
<p>In its broadest sense the church is that body of
people who have been called out of sin into the service
of Christ. As Jesus rules over this body of people, it
is his kingdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now when John heard in the prison the works of
Christ, he sent his disciples, and said unto him, art
thou he that cometh, or look we for another?&rdquo; In
similar fashion let us ask, Is Christianity the scheme
of redemption that was to come, or look we for
another? The future-kingdom advocates have answered,
No, we must look for another. On that point
they speak in no uncertain terms. It is argued that,
though Jesus came to establish his kingdom in Jerusalem
and to deliver the Jews from oppression, they
rejected him, and he postponed the establishment of
his kingdom till the time of his second coming. On
this assumption their use of the prophecies is a puzzle.
If the prophecies foretold the establishment of his
kingdom at his first coming, then they did not foretell
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
its establishment at his second coming; and the
future-kingdom advocates discredit the prophets by
seeking to make it appear that their prophecies can be
shifted from one period to another. And yet they have
the audacity to tell us that if things do not work out
according to their theory, no dependence can be placed
in what the prophets say. Well, half of their theory
has failed&mdash;the kingdom was not established, we are
told, at his first coming! Now they must shift the
prophecies to some future date.</p>
<p>Arthur Pink represents F. W. Grant as saying, in
the &ldquo;Numerical Bible,&rdquo; that Matthew shows, that because
Israel rejected Christ, the kingdom of heaven
would be taken from them, &ldquo;and assume the mystery
form in which it was unknown to the prophets of
Israel.&rdquo; (page 2). Again (p. 13) Pink says, &ldquo;But
the Old Testament <i>knows nothing whatsoever of
Christianity</i>!&rdquo; All future-kingdom advocates from
whom I quote hold this same idea. In fact their theory
makes it necessary for them to deny that any Old
Testament promise or prophecy referred to the scheme
of redemption preached by the apostles. In the Word
and Work (January 1945) J. Edward Boyd says, &ldquo;The
prophets had clearly seen and foretold the kingdom
gloriously triumphant, all opposition crushed, universal
in its sway; but this present aspect of the kingdom,
the church, although in the mind of God all along, they
had not been permitted to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a well known fact that the Jews expected the
old kingdom to be restored and enlarged with the
Messiah on the throne in Jerusalem; and R. H. Boll
says, &ldquo;Their expectations and conceptions of the king
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
and kingdom had their origin in these Old Testament
prophecies.&rdquo; (Kingdom of God, p. 25.) &ldquo;They saw in
him that promised Coming One of David&rsquo;s line who
would free his nation from the Gentile&rsquo;s yoke and
reign over the house of Jacob, and through it over all
the nations of the earth. For so it was promised.&rdquo;
(p. 26). &ldquo;The Old Testament prophecies and promises
of the kingdom were the theme of our preceding
studies.... By such predictions as those was the
kingdom-hope of Israel created; and that most justly
and nationally. When John the Baptist lifted up his
voice in the wilderness of Judea and announced &lsquo;the
kingdom at hand&rsquo; he used a phraseology which was
already common and current among the Jews, and
which was perfectly understood by all.&rdquo; Read that
again. If the phrase &ldquo;the kingdom of heaven&rdquo; was
&ldquo;common and current among the Jews,&rdquo; it was a
phrase of their own invention, for no Old Testament
prophecy contains the phrase. Matt. 3:2 is the first
place it occurs in the Bible. Again (p. 34): &ldquo;But if
the Jewish expectations had been utterly wrong
(which, as we have seen in our former articles, was
not the case), even then a sense of justice would suggest
that God would not have left the people under
such misapprehension without a clear protest and
correction.&rdquo; Read that again. Does he mean to say,
that if God announced a kingdom different from what
the Jews expected without telling them so, he did not
have a proper sense of justice? Or does he mean that
his own sense of justice would suggest that God
should have made the explanation suggested? In
either case, he crosses himself up; for he says that
Jesus began in Matthew thirteen to talk about the
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
mystery form of the kingdom. But Jesus did not
give any hint, that as the Jews had rejected him, the
kingdom they expected was now postponed and an entirely
new sort of kingdom would be presented. And
strange to say, he kept on using the term &ldquo;kingdom of
heaven,&rdquo; without telling them he was now using the
term in an entirely new sense. In fact the Jewish
idea remained with the disciples up to the ascension
of Christ. Now, what about that sense of justice?</p>
<p>AT HAND:&mdash;John the Baptist preached, &ldquo;Repent
ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rdquo; (Matt.
3:2). Jesus preached, &ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the
kingdom of God is at hand.&rdquo; (Mark 1:14, 15) This
plain language gives the future kingdom advocates a
lot of trouble. According to John R. Rice, they soon
quit preaching &ldquo;the kingdom at hand.&rdquo; He presents
this question: &ldquo;Is there a single time after tenth
chapter of Matthew ... that they preached that
the kingdom of heaven is at hand? I say it isn&rsquo;t
there.&rdquo; Again, &ldquo;After Jesus was rejected definitely
by the nation, the kingdom was no longer at hand.&rdquo;
He argues that the kingdom was postponed till the
second coming of Christ. But he overlooked what
Jesus told the seventy to preach. (Luke 10:1-11).
Verse 9: &ldquo;The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.&rdquo;
Verse 11: &ldquo;nevertheless know this, that the kingdom
of God is come nigh.&rdquo; This preaching was done during
the last year of Christ&rsquo;s personal ministry. So what
Rice says &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; is there; and he would have
seen it if he had been looking for truth instead of proof
to sustain a theory.</p>
<p>The following sentence from Brother R. H. Boll
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
shows that he realized the difficulty and tried to hedge
against it: &ldquo;If it be felt a difficulty that the kingdom,
though announced as &lsquo;at hand&rsquo;, has never yet appeared,
we shall find an explanation unforced and
natural, and one which will cast no reflection on the
truth and goodness of God.&rdquo; (K. p. 34). That statement
shows clearly that he realized some explanation
was needed to keep his theory from casting reflection
on the truth and goodness of God; but it seems to me
that his attempt at an &ldquo;unforced and natural&rdquo; explanation
helps not at all. Hear him: &ldquo;Since the
kingdom promise was national, the preparatory repentance
must of course also be national: the rulers
and the rank and file of the people to all of whom the
kingdom was dear, must now sincerely turn and return
to God.&rdquo; Passing by his assertion that &ldquo;the kingdom
promise was national,&rdquo; I call attention to the &ldquo;national
repentance&rdquo; idea. Nowhere is there even a hint that
John and Jesus told the people that the establishment
of the kingdom depended on &ldquo;national repentance.&rdquo;
Neither said, &ldquo;The time is fulfilled and the kingdom is
at hand, provided the nation repents; otherwise it will
be postponed to some future time.&rdquo; But not a word
about national repentance, not a word about national
rejection and its results, not a word about postponing
the kingdom; and yet in the absence of any such warning,
we are told that the kingdom was postponed. Now,
what about that sense of justice? Quoting again:
&ldquo;The announcement of the kingdom thus became the
basis of the call to repentance.&rdquo; One motive to cause
them to repent was the promised kingdom. Vast
multitudes were moved by that promise to repent and
be baptized. (Mark 1:5; John 4:1, 2). Multitudes
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
did as commanded; and yet according to the future
kingdom advocates none of them received what was
promised of them. It seems to me that the explanation
reflects seriously on their proposition, and really
charges that God did not make good on his promises.
The explanation does not explain. What about that
sense of justice?</p>
<p>Paul preached the gospel to Jews and Gentiles without
distinction. Boll says this was a terrible perplexity
to all believing Jews. He adds: &ldquo;That the Gentiles
were to be blessed in Messianic days was no
mystery; <i>that</i> had been previously revealed. But the
observant reader of the prophets will notice that it is
always <i>after</i> the national restoration and exaltation of
Israel, and always through restored Israel and in subservience
to Israel, that the Gentiles were to be
blessed.&rdquo; But why quote more.</p>
<p>For a long time I have been preaching that all that
the prophets said about a plan of human redemption is
fulfilled in the plan of salvation preached by Christ
and his apostles and is recorded in the New Testament.
I have offered to affirm this proposition: THE
PLAN OF SALVATION SET FORTH IN THE NEW
TESTAMENT IS THE SCHEME OF HUMAN REDEMPTION
FORETOLD BY THE PROPHETS; or,
for <i>foretold by the prophets</i> substitute <i>foretold in
promise and prophecy</i>. Here is a fair proposition that
covers every point involved in the discussion of the
future-kingdom theory. When it is proved to be true,
then the whole future-kingdom theory is proved to be
false. Why put in time showing that the various
phases of the theory are false when one proposition
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
fully established proves the whole theory false? Why
show that their use of this prophecy and that prophecy
is wrong when you can with even more ease
show that the New Testament contradicts their use
of the prophecies?</p>
<p>Before giving the proof of the correctness of my
proposition I wish to mention another matter. Perhaps
a few personal words will not be out of place.
When I was in the Nashville Bible School out on
Spruce street, I had a family&mdash;my wife and two children.
We had very little money, but we managed by
much self-denial to pay rent on a little house, to buy
enough groceries to keep us alive, and to pay every
dollar of tuition. My youngest brother was with me,
and he paid his part of board and rent, and his tuition.
Some of the able bodied boys (students) paid neither
board nor tuition.</p>
<p>During those days Brother R. H. Boll and I became
good friends, and continued to be so for years. He
played the mandolin and his pal Robert Mahan played
the guitar. Frequently they would come to our little
home and entertain us with music. We enjoyed their
music, and was glad for them to come. I liked the two
Roberts, but became more intimate with Robert Boll.
Some years later he began to write for the Gospel
Advocate, but a break came between him and the Advocate
over what the Advocate called his &ldquo;speculating
about unfulfilled prophecies.&rdquo; Brother Boll started
up his Word and Work, but I did not see many copies
of it. There continued to be references to Boll&rsquo;s &ldquo;speculating
about unfulfilled prophecies.&rdquo; I remember distinctly
that I thought, &ldquo;Well, if speculating about <i>unfulfilled</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
prophecies is all that is the matter with him,
why worry? What he said about unfulfilled prophecies
might be as near right as what any body else said.
No one could be sure about an <i>unfulfilled</i> prophecy. So
why the fuss?&rdquo; You cannot imagine my surprise when
I began to study his booklets to see what he did say.
I found that &ldquo;speculating about unfulfilled prophecies&rdquo;
was not what was the matter with him at all.
With him the land promise to the Jews is yet to be
realized, the Jews are yet to return to Palestine, the
kingdom of Daniel 2:44 has not yet been set up, that
Christ has not been seated on David&rsquo;s throne. To say
that his teaching is speculation about unfulfilled prophecy
is to concede the point. If his teaching that the
prophecies concerning the throne of David are yet unfulfilled
is speculating about <i>unfulfilled prophecy</i>,
then Christ is not yet on David&rsquo;s throne. If he is on
David&rsquo;s throne, then Boll is misapplying prophecy instead
of speculating about unfulfilled prophecy. His
trouble is speculating about fulfilled prophecy&mdash;making
prophecies that have been fulfilled apply to some
imaginary future scheme of things. Speculating about
unfulfilled prophecy indeed! You have an argument
with him about prophecies that you believe have been
fulfilled, and he says they are yet to be fulfilled; and
then you virtually give up your contention by calling
it an argument about unfulfilled prophecy! It makes
the heart sick. What unfulfilled prophecies has Boll
been speculating about? When a man seeks to prove
by the prophets that the Jews are yet to be restored
to Palestine, that Christ is yet to be placed on David&rsquo;s
throne, that the new covenant is yet to be established,
that Christ is to be a world ruler with the Jews as
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
citizens of his kingdom and all others as serfs, that the
Gentiles were to be blessed only through restored Israel
and in subservience to Israel, that Christ is now
seeking to convert and train only enough people to
supply the needed number of rulers for a future kingdom,
is he speculating about unfulfilled prophecy? It
seems to me that Boll does very little speculating about
unfulfilled prophecy compared with his use of prophecies
that have been fulfilled. How can intelligent people
be so dense?</p>
<p>In the early part of 1925 Brother C. R. Nichol and
I made the first real attempt that was made to review
Brother Boll&rsquo;s teaching. We worked together, and no
two men ever tried harder to understand exactly what
another man had written. And yet some people, who
should have known better, said we misrepresented
Brother Boll and did much to hinder the effectiveness
of our work. An example: A few brethren were talking
together on the sidewalk in Nashville. An aged
preacher of considerable ability and fame charged
that we misrepresented Brother Boll, and was very
caustic in his remarks. One of the group, a friend of
ours, said: &ldquo;Did you ever read their review?&rdquo; Critic:
&ldquo;No, no; I never read it.&rdquo; Friend: &ldquo;Well, did you read
what Boll said?&rdquo; Critic: &ldquo;No, no, I never read it.&rdquo;
Friend: &ldquo;Well, you are not in a position to say anything
about it.&rdquo; And that ended the conversation.</p>
<p>No, we did not misrepresent Brother Boll. But herein
is a peculiar thing. Many who said we misrepresented
Boll said they did not believe his theories. If
so, then they believed he misrepresented the Bible&mdash;misrepresented
God; and yet in the estimation of some
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
of them he was a very godly and pious man, even
though he did misrepresent God. But they fancied
that we misrepresented Brother Boll, we greatly
sinned! Can you beat it? I can honestly claim that we
were as sincere and honest in dealing With Brother
Boll&rsquo;s writings as his most devoted friends can claim
honesty and sincerity for him in his dealings with the
inspired writings.</p>
<p>One of the strangest, if not the zaniest things in all
this controversy is that some brethren not only misrepresent
themselves, but actually contradict themselves.
An example out of many: A written discussion
was had with Brother Boll in which Brother Boll contended
that the land promise to Abraham is yet unfulfilled,
that the prophecies concerning the seating
of Christ on David&rsquo;s throne are unfulfilled, and so on.
Then that debate was published in a book form with
the title, &ldquo;A Debate About Unfulfilled Prophecy!&rdquo; And
thus unwittingly the whole issue was surrendered,
virtually saying to Brother Boll, &ldquo;You are right; the
prophecies we have been debating about are unfulfilled.&rdquo;
Can you top that?</p>
<h3>Pointed Paragraphs:</h3>
<p class="bq">If you are inclined to think that denominations are
the branches Jesus spoke of, a little reflection will show
you how impossible that is. He meant individuals, not denominations.
And the diversity among the denominations
also shows that they are not branches of the vine. No
one ever saw a vine with branches so different as are the
denominations. They are not alike, and they bear different
kinds of fruit. It is impossible for them to be natural
branches of the same vine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<h2 id="c46"><span class="small">A PROPOSITION AND ITS PROOF</span></h2>
<p>THE PROPOSITION: The plan of Salvation
preached by Christ and his apostles is the scheme of
redemption foretold in promise and prophecy.</p>
<p>This proposition needs no defining. I am aware of
the fact that some future-kingdom advocates do not
go so far as to say that none of the prophecies referred
Christianity; but the ones from whom I quoted in the
preceding article, as well as many others, boldly teach
that Christianity is unknown to the prophets. In so
arguing they commit themselves to the fact that only
one scheme of redemption was foretold by the prophets.
On this point we agree. Hence, to prove that
Christianity was foretold by the prophets is to eliminate
any other scheme yet to be. In establishing my
proposition I shall rely solely on what is said in the
New Testament, for Jesus and his inspired representatives
are the infallible interpreters of the prophets.</p>
<p>They tell us that Jesus, in Matt. 13, began to set
forth a new plan, the plan of which the prophets said
nothing; yet in his speech Jesus said: &ldquo;But blessed are
your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and
righteous men desired to see the things which ye see
and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye
hear, and heard them not.&rdquo; (Matt. 13:16, 17.) Now
how could these prophets and righteous men have desired
to see and to hear what these disciples were then
seeing and hearing if it had never been revealed to
them that such things would be?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Late in the day on which Jesus arose from the dead
two of his disciples went out to Emmaus. They knew
that the body of Jesus was missing, but it seems that
they did not know he had been seen alive. Along the
way Jesus joined them, but they did not recognize him.
They related to him what they knew of recent events,
and added: &ldquo;But we hoped that it was he who should
redeem Israel.&rdquo; (Luke 24:21.) They had hoped for
freedom from Rome&mdash;redemption for the nation from
Roman rule. These are the opening words of a speech
that Jesus made to them: &ldquo;O foolish men, and slow of
heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!&rdquo;
(verse 25). Does not that virtually say that they, in
thinking the prophets spoke of political deliverance,
had not really believed what Moses and the prophets
had foretold? They had believed that Jesus would
give them an earthly kingdom; they had not believed
what Moses and the prophets had foretold. They
needed a better understanding of Moses and the prophets.
&ldquo;And beginning from Moses and all the prophets,
he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the
things concerning himself.&rdquo; If we had that speech!</p>
<p>In the great commission Jesus commanded the apostles
to make disciples of all the nations&mdash;to preach the
gospel to the whole creation. This was a demand for
world-wide evangelism, regardless of race or nationality.
Had such evangelism been foretold by the prophets?
What saith the Lord? In Luke&rsquo;s account of
this commission he quotes Jesus as saying: &ldquo;Thus it
is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise
again from the dead the third day; and that repentance
and remission of sins should be preached in his
name unto all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. Ye
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
are witnesses of these things. And behold, I send
forth the promise of my Father upon you; but tarry ye
in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on
high.&rdquo; (Luke 24:46-49.) Notice what Jesus says had
been written in the prophets&mdash;his death and resurrection,
and that repentance and remission of sins
should be preached in his name unto all nations, and
that this preaching should begin from Jerusalem. So
then, this world-wide evangelism, which was commanded
by Christ and preached first by his apostles
at Jerusalem, had been foretold by the prophets. And
this began to be preached on Pentecost, the day the
Holy Spirit filled them with power from on high.
Here a plan of salvation was preached, and this plan
had been foretold by the prophets. As only one plan
was foretold by the prophets, they foretold no other
plan than the one which began to be preached at
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In his sermon on the day of Pentecost, Peter showed
that Joel had prophesied of that day. He also quotes
a prophecy of David, which he interprets to refer to
the resurrection of Christ and his being seated on the
throne of David, and then draws this conclusion: &ldquo;Being
therefore by the right hand of God exalted, and
having received of the Father the promise of the
Holy Spirit, he hath poured forth this, which ye
see and hear.&rdquo; (Acts 2:33.) His argument was that
Jesus had been raised up to sit on David&rsquo;s throne, and
he concludes that he had, therefore, been exalted. Yet
Boll says: &ldquo;To him, and to him exclusively, the throne
of David belongs by every right. But that he is now
already occupying that throne is precisely that which
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
Peter does not say.&rdquo; What, then, is the connection
between Peter&rsquo;s argument and his conclusion? Peter&rsquo;s
argument followed immediately by <i>therefore</i> is significant.
Can any one believe that Peter argued from
David&rsquo;s prophecy that Jesus had been raised up to
sit on David&rsquo;s throne, and conclude that he had <i>therefore</i>
been exalted to something else?</p>
<p>On that day, and in the city of Jerusalem, repentance
and remission of sins in the name of Christ began
to be preached, and Jesus tells us that the prophets
had foretold this very thing. Because he was
now anointed&mdash;made both Lord and Christ&mdash;things
began to be done in his name. Hear Boll again: &ldquo;He
is the anointed King of David&rsquo;s line, the Christ appointed
for Israel. (Acts 3:20.) But neither is that
saying that he now sits and reigns on David&rsquo;s throne.
David had been anointed God&rsquo;s king long before he actually
sat upon his rightful throne over Israel, suffering
indignities and persecution at the hands of Saul,
and rejection at the hands of the people; and he never
took the government until the people themselves willingly
sought his rule and chose him and submitted.&rdquo;
But Bro. Boll overlooks the decisive point. Nothing in
the kingdom was done in the name of David till he
actually &ldquo;took the government.&rdquo; When he actually became
king, things began to be done in his name and
by his authority. If Boll could show that nothing is
yet done in the name of Christ, there would be some
point in what he says about David. The fact that pardon
was offered the enemies of Christ on the condition
that they would repent and be baptized shows
that he was then actually the reigning king. In Boll&rsquo;s
theory Jesus is only the heir apparent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>When Peter first preached to the Gentiles, he went
against the prejudices of all Jews, including himself.
Could he quote any prophecy to fit the occasion? He
was preaching to the Gentiles independent of Israel
and against the prejudices of Israel, and yet he said:
&ldquo;To him bear all the prophets witness, that through
his name every one that believeth on him shall receive
remission of sins.&rdquo; (Acts 10:43.) This inspired apostle
understood that the prophets foretold the very thing
that he was then doing&mdash;namely, offering salvation to
the Gentiles independent of Israel. Hence, the only
plan of salvation foretold by the prophets was then in
operation.</p>
<p>When the Jews of Antioch of Pisidia &ldquo;contradicted
the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed,&rdquo;
he said to them: &ldquo;Lo we turn to the Gentiles.
For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I
have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou
shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of
the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence, in preaching salvation to the Gentiles, Paul
was carrying out the prophecy of Isaiah. (Acts 13:44-47.)</p>
<p>Paul preached to Jews and Gentiles alike, and affirmed
that there was no distinction; and the people
of Berea searched the Scriptures daily to see whether
his preaching was so. This led many of them to believe.
(Acts 17:10-12.) Now, if the prophets had said
nothing concerning the plan of salvation Paul was
preaching, but had always foretold that Gentiles would
be blessed only through Israel restored and in subservience
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
to Israel, their searching the Scriptures would
have led these Bereans to the conclusion that Paul
was wrong.</p>
<p>Paul was sent to preach especially to the Gentiles;
he was the apostle to the Gentiles. Not only did he
preach to the Gentiles independent of the Jews, but in
spite of them. &ldquo;For this cause,&rdquo; said he to Agrippa,
&ldquo;the Jews seized me in the temple, and assayed to
kill me. Having therefore obtained the help that is
from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to
small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets
and Moses did say should come: how that the
Christ should suffer, and how that he first by the resurrection
of the dead should proclaim light both to the
people and to the Gentiles.&rdquo; The gospel which he
preached was foretold by the prophets and Moses,
and he preached nothing that had not been foretold
by them. Because of this he said to Agrippa: &ldquo;King
Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that
thou believest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called apostle,
separated unto the gospel of God, which he promised
afore through his prophets in the holy scriptures.&rdquo;
Paul&rsquo;s call is recorded in Acts 26:12-20. Concerning
this call he later said: &ldquo;But when it was the good pleasure
of God, who separated me, even from my mother&rsquo;s
womb, and called me through his grace, to reveal
his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles;
straightway I conferred not with flesh and
blood.&rdquo; (Gal. 1:15, 16.) And Paul fought hard to keep
the gospel of Christ free from all taint of Judaism
and to maintain his right to preach the gospel to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
Gentiles; and he pronounced a curse upon those Judaizing
Christians who would corrupt the gospel by mixing
it with Judaism (Gal. 1:6-9); and he affirms that
this gospel which he preached was the gospel which
God &ldquo;promised afore through his prophets in the holy
scriptures.&rdquo; The whole theory of the future-kingdom
advocates, as well as some things they boldly affirm,
is an emphatic denial of what Paul here says. It is
plain to any thoughtful person that the plan of salvation
which Paul preached is the scheme of redemption
foretold by the prophets.</p>
<p>Notice the <i>now</i> in the following: &ldquo;But now apart
from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested,
being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus
Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction.&rdquo;
(Rom. 3:21, 22.) This righteousness of
God, which had now been manifested, was to all believers
without race or national distinction; and this
righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ is witnessed
by the law and the prophets; and as the law
and the prophets gave witness to only one scheme of
redemption, it is plain that the future-kingdom hopes
have no basis.</p>
<p>Paul shows that the promise made to Abraham is
fulfilled in those who are children of God by faith in
Christ. (Gal. 3:22-29; 4:28-31.) And it seems that
the book of Hebrews was written to counteract the
teaching of the Judaizers of the church. That letter
plainly shows that the types and shadows of the law
pointed definitely to the church&mdash;to this plan of salvation
through Christ. And in the eighth, ninth, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
tenth chapters the writer shows that the new covenant,
or New Testament, foretold by Jeremiah is now
in force; yet Boll says concerning the new birth: &ldquo;It
is the universal requirement of acceptance with God,
and characteristic of the new covenant which now in
its principle applies to the church, and which the Lord
will make with the house of Israel and with the house
of Judah &lsquo;after those days&rsquo;.&rdquo; The new covenant now
applies to us only in principle&mdash;it is yet to be made!
To what extremes people will go to maintain a groundless
theory! Jesus is now the mediator of a better covenant,
&ldquo;which hath been enacted upon better promises,&rdquo;
not will be enacted. &ldquo;He taketh away the first,
that he may establish the second. By which will we
have been sanctified.&rdquo; (Heb. 10:9, 10.) The man who
can read the book of Hebrews and not see that the
types and shadows of the law pointed to Christianity
as we have it now simply does not see what he reads.
They desire to be teachers of the prophecies and the
law, &ldquo;though they understand neither what they say,
nor whereof they confidently affirm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concerning which salvation the prophets sought
and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace
that should come unto you: searching what time or
what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was
in them did point unto, when it testified beforehand
the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should
follow them. To whom it was revealed, that not unto
themselves, but unto you, did they minister these
things, which now have been announced unto you
through them that preached the gospel unto you by
the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven.&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:10-12.)
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
While the prophets were foretelling the blessings
that were to come, they were &ldquo;searching what
time or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which
was in them did point unto.&rdquo; Many of the future-kingdom
advocates do not profess to know the time
of the fulfillment of what they say these prophets
foretold, but they, with one accord, profess to know
exactly the manner of the time&mdash;a thing the prophets
themselves did not know! They have that all figured
out&mdash;oh, so much wiser than the prophets! They tell
us in no uncertain terms the manner of that time, as
they have it figured out. But Peter explodes their
theory by telling us that these prophets were ministering
to us, and that the things they foretold had been
announced through them that preached the gospel by
the Holy Spirit sent forth from Heaven. As the prophets
foretold only one scheme of redemption, and that
scheme has been announced through them that
preached the gospel by the Holy Spirit, it is certain
that there will be no future scheme in operation.
Hence&mdash;</p>
<p>The plan of salvation preached by Christ and his
apostles is the scheme of redemption foretold in promise
and prophecy. Nor have I relied on my interpretation
of the prophecies to prove the proposition.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
